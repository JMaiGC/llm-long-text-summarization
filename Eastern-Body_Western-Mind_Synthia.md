## PREFACE TO THIS EDITION

- The chakra system has come of age in the West due to the growth of yoga centers and theories of energy healing.
- Chakras are now seen on T-shirts, candles, and jewelry, and have become a part of mainstream culture.
- People often ask the author how they can "clear their chakras," but few understand what a chakra is or have knowledge of the ancient Tantric yoga tradition from which it originates.
- The book addresses this by teaching an elegant system for understanding health and imbalances, while also being richly complex.
- It does not provide "one-size-fits-all" formulas that apply equally to all people or situations, but instead teaches universal principles that can be effectively applied with careful consideration and understanding.
- The book discusses how some chakras may be too open, while others can get mired in avoidance patterns and remain closed.
- It also explains how these unconscious defense patterns create excessive and deficient coping strategies that over time throw the system out of balance and alignment, affecting the body's health and quality of life.
- The chakras open sequentially during crucial stages of childhood, and can be unwittingly shut down by well-meaning parents whose own centers were compromised.
- The book discusses upward and downward currents of energy, and how each has a different purpose in the liberation and manifestation of one's life force.
- The chakra system is a map for the journey of individuation and awakening, connecting mind, body, and spirit within one comprehensive system.

## INTRODUCTION 
### Sacred Centers of the Self 
### DISCOVERING THE RAINBOW BRIDGE
- The seven colors of the rainbow represent an alternative to our binary black-and-white consciousness, offering us a world of multiple opportunities.
- Yoga philosophy teaches us that the serpent goddess, Kundalini, represents the evolutionary life force within each person. She awakens from her slumber in the earth to dance her way through each chakra, reestablishing the rainbow as a metaphysical bridge between matter and consciousness.
- Through this dance of transformation, the rainbow becomes the axis mundi—the central axis of the world that runs through the vertical core of each one of us.
- On our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again.
- Crossing the Rainbow Bridge is a mythic metaphor for the evolution of consciousness. To reclaim a myth is to put our personal work into a larger context—a context which deepens the meaning of our individual struggle.
- To restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.
- Passage through the chakras is an alchemical process of increasing refinement that unites light and shadow, male and female, spirit and matter, all in the crucible of the body and psyche. 

### WHEELS THAT HEAL

- Chakras: Centers of organization that receive, assimilate, and express life force energy, represented as spinning spheres of bioenergetic activity emanating from major nerve ganglia branching forward from the spinal column.
- Major Chakras: Seven in total, stacked in a column of energy from base of spine to top of head; also minor chakras in hands, feet, fingertips, and shoulders.
- Chakra Associations: Each chakra associated with a major area of human psychological health (survival, sexuality, power, love, communication, intuition, consciousness) and an archetypal element (earth, water, fire, air, sound, light, thought).
- Chakra Vibrations: Each chakra represents a vibrational state on a continuum from heavy to subtle; associated with colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) and steps between.
- Chakras as Bridge: As we learn to open and heal the chakras within us, we become the Rainbow Bridge—the living link between Heaven and Earth.

### THE HUMAN BIOCOMPUTER

- The word "chakra" literally means "disk." In modern times, disks are the common storage unit of programmed information. We can use this analogy and think of chakras as floppy disks that contain vital programs.
- We have a survival program that tells us when we need to eat, how many hours to sleep, and when to put on a sweater. It contains details such as how much money we think we need, what we are willing to do for that money, what constitutes a threat to our survival, and what makes us feel secure.
- Likewise, we have programs for sexuality, power, love, and communication. In this analogy, the seventh chakra can be thought of as the operating system. It represents how we organize and interpret all our other programs.
- The challenge before us is to find the appropriate program and get the bugs out. In this analogy, the body is the hardware, our programming is the software, and the Self is the user. However, we did not write all of these programs, and some of their language is so archaic it is unintelligible.
- Activation requires a charge of energy moving through the psychic currents of the body. Human bodies are taller than they are wide, so our major energy pathways run vertically while subtler currents run in other directions. This leaves us with two essential poles: the earth-centered pole, which we contact through our bodies, and the pole of consciousness, which we experience through our minds.
- Between these poles runs a dynamic flow of energy that we experience as our life force. When energetic contact is made through the body, it is called grounding. Grounding comes from the solid contact we make with the earth, especially through our feet and legs. It is rooted in sensation, feeling, action, and the solidity of the material world.
- Grounding provides a connection that makes us feel safe, alive, centered in ourselves, and rooted in our environment. Consciousness, on the other hand, comes through that elusive entity we call the mind. It is our inner understanding, our memory, our dreams and beliefs. It also organizes our sensate information.
- When energetic contact is made through the body, it is called grounding. Grounding comes from the solid contact we make with the earth, especially through our feet and legs. It is rooted in sensation, feeling, action, and the solidity of the material world.

### CHAKRA BLOCKAGE

- What Blocks a Chakra: Childhood traumas, cultural conditioning, limited belief systems, restrictive or exhausting habits, physical and emotional injuries, or lack of attention contribute to chakra blockage. Difficulties in life lead to chronic patterns that become defense structures, causing chronic tension (body armor) affecting posture, breathing, metabolism, emotions, perceptions, interpretations, and belief systems.
- Unblocking a Chakra: Understand the dynamics of each chakra, examine personal history related to issues, apply exercises and techniques, balance excess and deficiency.
- Excess and Deficiency: Overbound or excessive coping strategies involve increasing energy and attention (e.g., dominating others), while underbound or deficient strategies involve decreasing it (e.g., avoiding conflict). Both restrict the flow of energy through the system, leading to dysfunctional behavior and health problems.
- Healing Imbalances: Opening an excessive chakra requires discharging energy, while a deficient one needs receiving energy. Subtleties may arise, such as strengthening underlying deficiencies or creating support by strengthening chakras below it. 
- Approaches include verbal discussion, physical work with the body and movement, spiritual meditation, emotional exploration of feelings, visualization, aural sounds, and actualizing tasks in outer-world life.

### CHARACTER ARMOR

- Excess and deficiency become part of chronic holding patterns, which can develop into character armor as bio-energetic terms describing coping strategies and their chronic holding patterns locked in the posture and tissues of the body.
- Character structure describes overall patterns of armoring in the body, with six basic types identified by Alexander Lowen based on Wilhelm Reich's pioneering work.
- Most people exhibit at least one of these six character structures, with shades and overtones of the other structures.
- The **Schizoid/Creative** structure results from first chakra alienation, characterized by a split between mind and body, highly creative individuals with overdeveloped upper chakras.
 - The **Oral/Lover** structure is discussed in the second chakra chapter, resulting from deprivation in the nurturing/nourishment stage of dependency related to chakras one and two.
- The **Masochist/Endurer** structure is fixated at chakra three with energy bound at the will, robbed of their autonomy, holding everything inside in a conflicting pattern of pleasing and resisting.
- The **Rigid/Achiever** structure focuses on achievement, highly functional but often afraid of relationships, commitment, and feelings of intimacy.
- The **Hysteric** structure is a variation on the Rigid/Achiever, with similar wounds and patterns, but where emotions are initially held back, they later erupt with an intensity.
- The **Psychopath/Challenger-Defender** structure is developmentally related to the third chakra, oriented toward power-over and challenging the strong.

### THE SEVEN RIGHTS

1. Chakra One: The right to be here - Instinctual sense of right to exist, difficulty with this right, right to take up space, individuality, right to take care of oneself, foundation for survival and security, right to have.
2. Chakra Two: The right to feel - Culture frowns upon emotional expression, difficulty expressing emotions, importance of feeling, right to want, right to enjoy healthy sexuality.
3. Chakra Three: The right to act - Cultures with narrowly defined behavior patterns, fear of punishment and blind obedience, need for freedom to develop inner authority.
4. Chakra Four: The right to love and be loved - Damaged by dysfunctional families, cultural prejudice, war, poor self-esteem, broken will, inability to feel or communicate.
5. Chakra Five: The right to speak and hear truth - Not allowed to speak truthfully in family, not being heard when speaking, keeping family secrets, not being spoken to honestly, government lying.
6. Chakra Six: The right to see - Told what one perceives is not real, things deliberately hidden or denied, diminished ability to see due to frequent angry or frightening scenes.
7. Chakra Seven: The right to know - Includes the right to accurate information, truth, knowledge, and simply knowing what's going on; importance of education and spiritual rights.

### THE SEVEN IDENTITIES

1. Our first identity level is known as the physical identity, and its job is self-preservation. Here we learn to identify with the body—when my body is hungry, I am hungry, when it hurts, I hurt.
2. Beneath the surface of the body churn the emotions. The emotions are the clothing of our feelings. When we experience a strong emotion, we feel our aliveness and often identify with the feeling involved.
3. In the third chakra, we identify with our will, behavior, and our actions. This is where we realize that we are a separate entity with the power to choose our own actions and consequences.
4. In the fourth chakra, we create a social identity, also known as the persona. The persona is the personality created to interact with others—it is the part of ourselves that the ego allows to rise above the surface, separated off from the shadow.
5. The fifth chakra is the center of our creative identity. Here we identify with our self-expression—what we say and produce. Initially, we identify with our word through the commitments we make.
6. In the sixth chakra, we expand into our archetypal identity, transforming the individual I into something transpersonal. Our personal story is now seen as an event in a larger story.
7. In the crown chakra, we come to the final and largest identity: our universal identity. The more our consciousness expands, the larger our identity can become. As we realize the magnificent scope of the cosmos, we have the opportunity to transcend our smaller, more limited world, and identify with the entire universe.

### DEMONS OF THE CHAKRAS

1. Fear arises when something threatens survival; it prevents feeling secure, focused, and calm.
2. Guilt undermines natural flow of emotional and sexual energy, inhibiting reaching out to others.
3. Shame undermines self-esteem, personal power, spontaneous activity, and joy; it collapses the third chakra and turns its radiating energy inward against the self.
4. Grief counteracts heart's lightness and expansion, making it feel heavy and closed; it results from hurts to the heart.
5. Lies twist our relationship with the outside world through distorted information.
6. Illusion fixates attention and keeps us from seeing accurately.
7. Attachment is a small focus of attention that obscures realization and unity with cosmic consciousness.

### DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES

1. The first chakra relates to the formation of the physical body and takes place during prenatal development and infancy. In this stage, body growth is most rapid, and is therefore the main focus of the life force.
2. The second chakra, which is typified by duality, sensation, feeling, and mobility, comes into conscious attention at about six months when visual acuity allows the child to focus on outside objects and gain a wider visual perspective. 
3. The third chakra begins with the period of attempted autonomy that occurs with the "terrible twos" (also known as the willful stage). 
4. The fourth chakra develops as one leaves the stubborn egocentricity of the third chakra and begins to show interest in relationships outside of the primary ones with Mother and Father.
5. The fifth chakra is the stage of creative expression. Once the social identity is developed and one understands basic relationships between Self and world, a period of personal creativity unfolds. 
6. The awakening of this chakra requires an ability to recognize patterns and apply them to life decisions. 
7. The seventh chakra is related to the pursuit of knowledge, the formation of a worldview, and the awakening of spiritual pursuits. 

### INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: THE CHAKRA SYSTEM AS A WHOLE

Chakra System as a Whole: The development of consciousness involves both ascending and descending energy currents. This process is influenced by Ken Wilber's developmental psychology, which explains how the descent of consciousness from the crown chakra couples with the organization of raw energy from below, allowing individuals to move on to the next stage.

#### Adult Development 

The process of individuation involves becoming a single, homogeneous being and embracing one's innermost uniqueness. This journey begins in early adulthood when individuals leave home and start living independently.

1. Chakra One: Survival is the primary issue during this stage, which includes getting a place to live, learning self-care, and finding an independent income source. The time spent on this stage varies from person to person, with some spending their entire lives struggling for survival.
2. Chakra Two: Once basic independence is achieved, individuals form sexual relationships. This stage involves satisfying emotional needs, often projected onto a partner. Emotional frustration may arise due to unresolved childhood conflicts or the inability to develop personal will and responsibility.
3. Chakra Three: The individuation process allows individuals to become true individuals operating under their own power and will. This stage is marked by the liberation from conforming to parental, cultural, or societal expectations. It may be triggered by meaningless jobs or enslavement in relationships where one's needs are defined by others.
4. Chakra Four:  Relationships become more empathetic and altruistic during this stage, focusing on maintaining lasting partnerships. This may involve reevaluating behavior towards others, examining family dynamics, and building connections with colleagues, friends, and the community.
5. Chakra Five: Creative and personal expression is emphasized in this stage, where individuals make their personal contribution to the community. It often occurs around midlife and may precede or dominate other activities for more creative personalities.
6. Chakra Six: This introverted stage involves reflection and study of patterns through exploration of mythology, religion, and philosophy. It is a time of searching and spiritual interest, which intensifies when children are grown and adults have more freedom for contemplation and spiritual practice.
7. Chakra Seven: The final stage is characterized by wisdom, spiritual understanding, knowledge, and teaching. Individuals bring together information gathered throughout life to pass it on to others or pursue a spiritual path.

## CHAKRA ONE 
Temple of the Body 
### FIRST CHAKRA AT A GLANCE


The first chakra, also known as the Muladhara or root chakra, is located at the base of the spine and is associated with the element Earth. Its primary purpose is to provide a foundation for our physical existence, grounding us in the present moment and nourishing our bodies. Issues related to the first chakra include trust, health, home, family, prosperity, and appropriate boundaries.

The color red is often associated with this chakra, symbolizing vitality and passion. The location of the first chakra at the base of the spine corresponds to the coccygeal plexus, which is responsible for controlling the muscles in the pelvic region. This area also houses the reproductive organs and the bladder.

The identity associated with the first chakra is physical self-preservation, as it focuses on our basic needs and survival instincts. The demon associated with this chakra is fear, which can manifest in various ways such as anxiety, restlessness, or a lack of trust in the world.

Developmental tasks related to the first chakra include physical growth, motor skills, and object permanence during the second trimester to 12 months of life. The basic rights associated with this chakra are the right to be here and have a sense of safety and security. Balanced characteristics include good health, vitality, being well-grounded in one's body, comfort in one's physical form, trust in the world, and the ability to relax and be still.

Traumas and abuses associated with the first chakra can include birth trauma, abandonment or physical neglect, poor physical bonding with the mother, malnourishment, feeding difficulties, major illness or surgery, physical abuse or violent environment, enema abuse, and inherited traumas from parents who experienced survival fears (e.g., holocaust survivors, war veterans, poverty conditions).

Deficiencies related to this chakra include disconnection from one's body, being notably underweight, fearfulness, anxiety, restlessness, poor focus and discipline, financial difficulty, and poor boundaries. Excesses can manifest as obesity or overeating, hoarding, material fixation, greed, sluggishness, laziness, tiredness, fear of change, and addiction to security.

Physical malfunctions associated with the first chakra include disorders of the bowel, anus, large intestine; disorders of solid parts of the body (bones, teeth); issues with legs, feet, knees, base of spine, buttocks; eating disorders; and frequent illnesses (which can be deficient or excessive).

Healing practices for the first chakra include reconnecting with one's body through physical activity such as aerobics, weights, running, dance, lots of touch, massage, bioenergetic grounding, hatha yoga, and looking at early childhood relationships with one's mother. Affirmations related to this chakra can include "It is safe for me to be here," "The earth supports me and meets my needs," and "I love my body and trust its wisdom."

### BASIC ISSUES

The first chakra, also known as the root chakra or Muladhara, is the foundation of our energy system and plays a crucial role in our overall well-being. It is located at the base of the spine and is associated with the color red. This chakra governs our physical body, survival instincts, sense of security, grounding, nourishment, trust, health, home, family, and prosperity.

The root chakra is responsible for our basic needs such as food, shelter, and safety. It helps us establish a strong foundation in life by providing stability and grounding. When this chakra is balanced, we feel secure, confident, and connected to the earth. We are able to trust ourselves and others, which allows us to form healthy relationships with our family and community.

On the other hand, when the root chakra is imbalanced, it can lead to feelings of insecurity, fear, anxiety, and even physical health issues such as digestive problems, lower back pain, or immune system weaknesses. To balance this chakra, one can practice grounding techniques like walking barefoot on the earth, yoga poses that stimulate the root chakra, and visualization exercises that involve imagining a bright red light at the base of the spine.

### THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE

1. *Foundation of the temple*: The foundation rests on the earth, connecting with our bodies as the home of our spirit. It is situated at the base of the spine, forming the first chakra.
2. *Building the foundation*: A strong, rooted foundation provides stability and allows for growth. It must be firm enough to provide support but also yielding enough to allow roots to penetrate the earth.
3. *Anchoring the temple*: The Sanskrit name of the first chakra, muladhara, means "root support." This anchors the temple deep into the earth.
4. *Defining the scope and boundaries*: The foundation defines the space in which we exist, providing a basic context for our experiences. It gives us a grounding point and allows us to establish boundaries.
5. *Determining the structure above*: The foundation largely determines the shape of the structure above it, influencing what can be built, how high it can go, and what kind of stresses it can withstand.
6. *Damage to the chakra*: Damage to the first chakra is reflected in each subsequent chakra, affecting the entire chakra system.
7. *Gaining solidity*: Building a strong foundation allows us to be firm and establish boundaries. Solidity has consistency, repetition, and accountability. Our bodies are the physical manifestation of our existence, with definable boundaries.
8. *Facing what is in front of us*: Being solid means facing challenges without flinching, remaining anchored in truth in the face of opposition, and maintaining calm and security.

#### SURVIVAL

- When threatened, survival dominates all other functions of consciousness.
- Frequent survival threats can lead to PTSD symptoms like insomnia, stress, and health problems.
- Damage to the first chakra leads to issues with survival, such as health, money, housing, or job problems.
- Survival instincts lie at the base of the collective unconscious and form natural impulses for self-defense and connection with the environment.
- Denying these instincts can lead to disembodiment and disconnection from the environment.
- Reclaiming the first chakra allows one to live harmoniously with survival instincts without being ruled by them.

#### THE DEMON OF FEAR

To overcome the Demon of Fear, it is essential to understand its origins and learn to relax and feel the subtle energies of our body. This involves allowing the body to express responses to fear, such as running away or becoming angry and activated, which helps complete the gestalt of the response to the original trauma. By acknowledging fear as an ally of self-preservation, we can develop a healthier pattern of behavior and strengthen our resources to effectively meet similar threats in the future.

#### GROUNDING

1. Grounding a healthy first chakra allows a person to be energetically grounded, which is critical for understanding basic aliveness and well-being. 2. Physically, this happens through the legs and feet, where excitement is passed up into the body and excess is discharged downward into the ground. 
3. Only by drawing energy up from the base can we create the liberating current that flows to the crown.
4. We feel more awake and alive when the downward current of consciousness connects with the body and meets the edges and boundaries of physical reality. 
5. To truly experience our body's aliveness is to experience a profoundly spiritual state— achieved by embracing our natural tendencies rather than denying them through ascetic practices.
6. When we are grounded, we can be present, focused, dynamic, and have an attention concentrated in the here and now. Our experience is direct, sensate, immediate. We are confident yet contained, connected with our own source of support.
7. Without grounding, we are unstable. We lose our center, fly off the handle, get swept off our feet, or daydream in the fantasy world. We lose our ability to contain, which is the ability to have and hold. If we cannot contain, we cannot hold our boundaries and build up inner power; thus, we cannot mature.

#### Boundaries

Without boundaries, natural excitement gets dissipated and diluted and becomes ineffectual. When we lose our ground, our attention wanders and we appear vague and insubstantial.

The healthy establishment of one's ground is the essential work of the first chakra, and the foundation for any further growth. Here lies the basic rights of the first chakra: the right to be here and to the right to have what we need in order to survive.

- Nourishment forces us to remain open as a system, in constant interaction with our environment. Without nourishment, we collapse. Persons who embody a sense of physical collapse are revealing a lack of support in their life and their bodies show a corresponding sense of defeat.
- Reclaiming our right to be here, learning to ground, and attending to our need for nourishment are all first chakra necessities.
- The characteristics of good grounding, connection with our bodies and the physical world, self-nourishment, and self-preservation contribute to the ability to manifest prosperity. This means being able to meet basic survival needs in ways that offer security, stability, and enough freedom to expand beyond survival consciousness.
- In order to meet these survival needs, we must be able to deal with our immediate physical environment—to extract from it what we need for our personal or familial preservation. This is the testing ground of our first chakra abilities. It gives us a means for our own independence, enabling us to stand on our own two feet, to stand in our own ground.

### GROWING THE LOTUS 
#### DEVELOPMENTAL FORMATION OF THE FIRST CHAKRA

1. Age: Womb to 12 months
2. Tasks: Physical growth, Motor development, Bonding
3. Needs and Issues: Trust, Nourishment, Safety, Right to be here

For the first several months of your life, you can't do anything for yourself. You understand nothing and have almost no control over your body or surroundings. You can't speak the language, so you can neither communicate nor understand anything said around you, yet your life depends on getting your needs met.

Trust or Mistrust: The meeting of your needs is beyond your control, yet you need everything. There is a frightening feeling that was not present in the womb. Things are not provided automatically as they were in the womb. There are periods of hunger, cold, discomfort, and pain. Whether these needs are miraculously met creates your psychological foundation for relating to the world: trust or mistrust.

Family Determines How We Find Our Ground: Trust enables your body to unfold from its cramped position, allows security and calm, and encourages connection, bonding, and exploration. 

With trust, the survival instinct is satisfied, and there is a sense of emotional well-being. If you are confident that the world is a friendly place, you have the sense that you will live. Without trust, your survival feels constantly threatened, and because there is nothing you can do to meet the threat, the anxiety is unbearable.

##### Substance of Survival: 

The substance of survival—feeding, holding, warmth, and physical comfort—must come from outside you. This is provided by your roots, meaning your parents, family, and caretakers. The degree to which parents succeed at this task depends a great deal on the kind of support they received as infants and children, and what kind of support system they have for themselves while you are young.

##### Environment as Self: 

For the developing fetus, the uterus is the first experience of body, the first home and environment, and the ground of being from which life emerges. The mother's nutritional balance and her emotional states during pregnancy play a role in the texture of the child's personal ground.

##### Birth: 
Birth is the gateway into life and the beginning of individuality. It is the first step in our lifelong journey and has a marked effect on how we feel about that journey. Yet the infant is not aware of that individuality for quite some time. For the first five to six months, she remains in a state of fused identity and has no concept of a separate self.

##### Trust vs. Mistrust: 

The need for the inner and outer worlds to remain consistent is extreme in the young child for many years to come, but especially during a period when there is no distinction. If our instinctual impulses do not get us the things we need in order to survive, we learn to distrust or ignore them, and simultaneously perceive the world as hostile.
##### Hope: 

Hope gives us confidence, enthusiasm, positive thinking, and excitement about life. It is the essential essence needed to thrive and move forward. The developmental tasks at this stage center around learning to operate the body as the basic vehicle of life. Awareness, coming down from the seventh chakra, is initially focused on the body itself as the child discovers

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

#### BIRTH TRAUMA

Our first survival experience involves separation from the mother after birth, which is fundamentally traumatic to infants.

- **Technological birth**: Infants pulled out into bright lights, spanked, and separated from the mother are shocked by this assault to their neurological sense of ground.
- **Male infants**: Circumcision without anesthesia further traumatizes them.

Hospitals are becoming more aware of the need for continuity from womb to mother and breast-feeding is making a comeback.

- **Postnatal contact**: This is crucial to mother-child bonding, which was previously neglected.
- **Ground-wrenching birth experiences**: Several generations have endured these, requiring conscious reclamation of body and ground for most of us.

Children of horrible births are more likely to cry, be needy, and have health problems, which can lead to parental stress and neglect/abuse.

A well-received child is relatively calm and receives positive regard from others in the first few months.

- **Incubator babies**: They are deprived of mother's touching and suckling, leading to a surreal view of life and distant relationships.
- **Isolation**: Adults who were incubator babies may accept isolation as normal due to missing safety and bonding experiences.

#### ABANDONMENT

- Children who are not touched enough experience abandonment, even when other care is provided.
- Institutionalized babies had a high death rate due to lack of touch, resulting in marasmus (wasting away).
- Abandonment can be subtle or blatant, and longer periods of separation create profound insecurity.
- Adoptive parents need to provide consistent love and security to make up for the child's separation anxiety.
- Abandonment threatens our survival, making us feel unwanted and doubt our right to be here.
- Fear of abandonment can inhibit appropriate responses in relationships, leading to fear of speaking up or accepting it too readily.
- Abandonment during the formative years often results in an excessive first chakra, clinging to security, food, loved ones, or routines.
- Abandonment by others creates a tendency to abandon oneself, leading to poor self-care and trust issues.

#### NEGLECT

*Neglect* is a subtler form of abandonment that can lead to instability, mistrust, and shame.

Neglect is often intermittent and counteracts the first chakra's job of stabilizing the system.

If neglect is mild enough for survival, it results in buried memories of helplessness without a concrete connection.

This instability leads to mistrust of others and further alienation from those who might provide support.

Neglect also impacts the third chakra's self-esteem and personal power, as well as the fourth chakra's right to be loved.

Like abandonment, neglect is often echoed in how we treat ourselves.

#### FEEDING DIFFICULTIES

* Malnourishment and hostile eating situations affect our ability to nourish ourselves, an essential first chakra function.
* The emotional state of the mother while feeding, inherited attitudes about food, and whether or not a child is breast-fed all impact this vital survival function.
* Some clients were not allowed to eat until their brothers were fed, or had to sit at the table for four hours until they ate a cold plate of eggs.
* Children may live in constant hunger or be overfed with poor quality foods.
* Adults who experienced these types of situations as children have difficulty interpreting true hunger messages and may develop food allergies, avoidance, or addiction to food.
* This can manifest as trust issues, eating disorders, digestive difficulties, or stagnant energy due to being a closed system unable to incorporate new input.
* Nourishment comes in many forms—food, friends, intellectual and creative stimulation—so this issue may translate to other areas of life.

#### ENEMAS

* Enemas can cause trauma to the first chakra, similar to sexual abuse.
* Repeated use of enemas destroys trust and fractures one's sense of solidity.
* Difficulty with boundaries is guaranteed, leading to either impenetrable walls or nonexistent boundaries.
* The child's right to have a first chakra is denied when their only solid creation is taken away against their will at an inappropriate time.
* John Bradshaw states that not all uses of enemas are abusive, but excessive, unnecessary, or punitive use can be considered abuse.

#### PHYSICAL ABUSE

1. *Physical abuse* causes pain and teaches children to dissociate from their bodily sensations.
2. Anxiety from the abuse produces stress hormones, which may become addictive and create a need for crisis throughout life.
3. Bodily dissociation can make one accident-prone and lead to minor injuries that bring one home to the familiar experience of pain.
4. Coping strategies for dealing with physical abuse can impact any and all of the chakras, especially first chakra issues.
5. Physical abuse may create excessive or deficient coping strategies, such as dissociation or obsession with the body.
6. The fragmenting effect of physical abuse on the nervous system is similar to its effect on subtle energy fields, making it hard to mend shattered stability and well-being.
7. Physical abuse usually comes from someone within the home, making daily life dangerous and fear a constant companion.

#### ACCIDENTS, SURGERIES, ILLNESSES

* Surgeries, severe illnesses, or accidental physical injuries can have traumatic effects on the body and nervous system.
* Even surgery necessary for survival can traumatize the body and psyche of the child going through the experience.
* Car accidents may have long-term emotional effects, such as unconscious fears, difficulty sleeping, changes in eating habits, prolonged nervousness, and difficulty concentrating.
* Effects from these events can be harder to decipher as they may have been dismissed as insignificant.
* The tendency to fragment may resemble the energetic process of the Schizoid structure without its other physical or emotional characteristics.

#### INHERITED TRAUMA

- *Inherited trauma* refers to fears and insecurities passed down from parents to their children without any direct abuse or trauma experienced by the child.
- It is possible for children to inherit first chakra issues from their parents without any direct abuse; this can result in attitudes and beliefs about the world's danger rather than physical manifestations.
- This inherited fear can contaminate the underlying ground of being with an unidentifiable layer of fear and distrust that eventually becomes part of the bodily experience.


#### BOUNDARIES

Poor boundaries can lead to various negative outcomes such as interfering with embodiment, discouraging future self-forming, and even resulting in legal issues or health problems. According to Keleman, when our own boundaries are not functioning properly, the world will provide them for us through rejection, jail time, or illness. However, if lower chakra needs have been met, individuals can set appropriate boundaries and withdraw from unproductive relationships without fear of dependence on others.

Keleman also highlights the impact of poor boundaries on codependency, which often stems from a childhood where a person had to care for their family members due to survival needs. In such cases, boundaries do not form, leading to a pragmatic contradiction in adulthood as survival requires boundaries.

#### UPPER CHAKRA DOMINANCE

Experiences that threaten survival intensify the upward movement of energy in the body, leading to a disconnection from bodily sensations and an overemphasis on mental awareness.

A person with upper chakra dominance may neglect basic needs like eating and resting, resulting in frequent illnesses.

*Mind-Body Split*: The disconnection from bodily sensations creates a profound mind-body split, making it difficult to identify and address underlying issues.

A person with upper chakra dominance may have an unawareness of their own ground, leading to confusion for both the individual and any therapist working with them.

To counteract upper chakra dominance, it is necessary to develop a downward current of energy and build a solid ground, similar to building a foundation brick by brick.

#### OBJECTIFYING THE BODY

* Neurotic ego dominates the body
* Schizoid ego denies it
* Schizophrenic ego dissociates from it

First chakra damage leads to alienation from the body

Objectification of self and others leads to seeing the body as a thing to control

#### OTHER CHAKRA IMBALANCES

* First Chakra Imbalances: Sexuality, personal power, relationships, communication affected; upper chakras intensified with elaborate imagination and intellect as defense against feeling.
* Extreme intensification can cause confusion, vagueness, or a feeling of going crazy.
* Answer lies in grounding and embodying consciousness.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE 

1. **Schizoid Character Structure**: Creative and Intelligent - A defense mechanism developed early in life to cope with danger to life and sanity, involving absolute control of the body by the mind.
2. **Unwanted Child**: Developed when a mother is fearful or resistant to pregnancy, leading to contraction as a normal way of being and withdrawal from life.
3. **Creative Character Structure**: High degree of intelligence, creativity, and interest in spiritual matters; questions right to be here due to lack of body affirmation.
4. **Schizoid/Creative Character**: Tall, thin, wiry, wide-open eyes, nervous, shaky, highly energized, manic attacks, anorexic, coiled rope around torso, blocked throat, hurried and frightened speech, highly sensitive mind, out of touch with body.

**Self-Care Assignments**: Eating, sleeping, massage, walks, pleasurable activities, reclaiming body piece by piece through drawing and movement.

**Boundary Adjustment**: Moving boundaries from withdrawn space to a feeling of safety; breaking the habit of contraction by pushing against a pillow.

**Recovery Process**: Gradual learning to pay attention to her body, trust more people, value herself, reclaim right to be here, and participate in life.

### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY

Determining excess and deficiency within a chakra is necessary before using most exercises. An excessive chakra benefits from relaxing or discharging exercises, while a deficient chakra benefits from stimulating or charging exercises. 

Charge is the body's basic excitement, felt when we are angry, excited, sexually aroused, scared, in love, or experiencing intense emotional states. Issues from childhood hold charge, and overreacting or compulsively avoiding charged situations may occur. Positive experiences also hold charge, giving us energy.

1. **Increasing Charge**: increases body awareness by increasing its aliveness. Depression is a state of undercharge, lacking excitement or enthusiasm. Not all charge is pleasurable; when the body is rigidly compressed, increased charge may be felt as anxiety. Chronic muscular tension defends against charge to avoid unwanted feelings.

2. **Deficiency**: _A deficient first chakra_ is contracted, vacant, weak, sloppy, or unformed. Contraction pulls inward and may center in the head, solar plexus, heart area, or downward into the ground. The person may be out of touch with feeling in this area. 
- A deficient first chakra needs to discover its ground, respond well to working while standing, and use exercises that charge the body.

4. **Excess**: _An excessive first chakra _feels heavy, has solidity but with a sluggish and massive feeling. The person may be large and dense, with excess weight around hips, thighs, or buttocks. The body is solidly formed and resistant to change. 
- Excessive first chakras need to discharge, let go, shift from excessive stability to movement and flow, and use physical movements like dancing, walking, swimming, or yoga for relaxation and subtle energy distribution.

**Balance**: A balanced first chakra is solidly grounded yet dynamically alive, with both flexibility and consistency. It has a sense of form without rigidity, bodily comfort, and healthy energy distribution. This gives inner security, good self-care, an affirmed right to be here, and a strong sense of presence.

**Assessing History**: Uncovering developmental life experiences can reveal excessive or deficient strategies. Neglect and rejection usually result in deficiency, while stressful situations may lead to excess. Persistent problems can be sorted into problems of excess or deficiency.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS 
#### HEALING THE FIRST CHAKRA

1. Determine state of connection with body, ground, and environment.
2. Observe walking, talking, moving, breathing, sitting, and eye contact for clues about underlying patterns.
3. Focus on energetic statements rather than emotions in first chakra work.
4. Keep person in touch with bodily sensations to provide containment for difficult material.
5. Use grounding suggestions like putting feet back down on the floor or standing up.
6. Have clients draw their own body without trying to make a realistic picture.
7. Analyze drawing for overlooked aspects and ask questions about it.
8. Compare drawing with person's life and discuss any discrepancies.
9. Make periodic drawings to track progress in healing.

#### BODY DIALOG

* Body Dialog Exercise: First step out of dissociation is reestablishing communication with body. Client lays down, therapist sits beside, ready to write down everything said. Client pretends body is a corporation, interviewing each part about their feelings.
* Each body part is a member of the corporation, client starts with "I am my feet and I..." and completes sentence with emotional experience.
* After all parts have spoken, therapist reads back what was written without mentioning body parts. Client sees how the body is expressing life experience.
* Dialog can then occur with significant parts of the body to understand their feelings and fears.
* Goal is to develop a relationship through communication and acknowledgment, leading to action and change.

#### AFFIRM THE PHYSICAL

1. When damaged, relationship with physical world is damaged; healing occurs through creating new relationship with body, earth, surroundings.
2. Touch and nurturing crucial for developing affirming and pleasurable relationship with body. Regular massage and physical exercise are indispensable. Massage helps break down contracted body armor while simultaneously providing a nurturing and pleasurable experience. Exercise pumps energy through the body and develops strength, promoting a sense of connection and pride.
3. Energized throughout by power of Dynamic Ground - Entire physical being is electrically charged; any bodily limbs, parts, or "zones" can become a seat of somatic ecstasy when caressed or manipulated.
4. Encourage client to anchor feelings in body by describing physical sensations. Every feeling has a physical sensation; once clarified, feeling can be deepened or lessened through exaggeration or opposite movement.
5. Body Numbness: Physical sensations have to be exaggerated in order to be noticed. Negative feelings can be lessened by instructing client in an opposite movement.
6. Grounding and Cathartic Release: Change body movements may evoke cathartic release, but proceed carefully if trauma is severe.
7. Emotional and Physical Structures Interdependence: Change in physical structure supports new emotional response; change in emotional expression supports new physical postures. Both sides must be worked simultaneously, but focus on the physical.

#### WORK ON THE FEET

- Working directly with the feet themselves or 
- Working while standing on the feet.

To open up the muscles in the feet, clients can stand on a tennis ball or footsie roller and press one foot into it while applying enough weight to loosen tension.

Doing psychological work while standing increases the body's energy, allows greater assertiveness, overcomes passivity, and supports independence.

#### GROUNDING EXERCISE

1. Grounding exercise: Place feet shoulder width apart, toes slightly inward, knees slightly bent; push into feet as if trying to part the floorboards, increasing leg solidity.
2. Maintain position while partner pushes on sternum, dig feet into floor, increase energy in legs.
3. Bend and straighten knees slowly, inhale while bending, exhale while straightening, push into floor; mild trembling in legs indicates new energy coming in.
4. Continue exercise to increase energy flow and charge; be careful of anxiety that may arise.
5. Anxiety can be curtailed by slowing down or stopping the exercise, kicking legs in front, sitting in a chair with head lowered.
6. Process anxiety by working with material it illuminates; Sally got uncomfortable, tingling in hands and lips, confused about instinctual response to needing someone when they were not there.
7. Allow person to grab your hands for solid contact, leading to feeling of calm.
8. Resolve issues brought to light by exercises, grounding gains solidity, problems with jobs, housing, physical ailments begin to resolve.

#### REGRESSIVE TECHNIQUES

* Rebirthing: Lying down, simulates womb/birth experience
* Holotropic breath work: Releases deep tensions in body

**Exercise 1**: Client lies on back, legs raised and waved, pushing feet outward, kicking legs rapidly after building up charge

**Exercise 2**: Lying down, massage shoulder/back muscles, reaching forward with hands, suckling response (pushing lips outward)
* Important to end with client feeling able to support himself in an adult way
 * Boundary implications, practitioner must establish clear boundaries and sense of safety/trust

### CONCLUSION

* The first chakra is essential for healthy functioning and avoiding mundane existence.
* Grounding is a slow, cumulative process that begins at the base of the chakras and changes as we build upon it.
* Our culture's disconnection from the physical world weakens our connection to the first chakra.
* Reclaiming our bodies and rights can be a joyful reunion with our grounded selves, leading to recovery through the chakras.

## CHAKRA TWO

The Second Chakra, also known as Svadhisthana, is located in the lower abdomen and is associated with the element of water. Its purpose is to facilitate movement and connection within oneself and with others. 

This chakra is responsible for emotions, sensations, sexuality, desire, need, and pleasure. The color orange represents this chakra, and its developmental stage ranges from 6 months to 2 years old.

The Second Chakra's balanced characteristics include graceful movement, emotional intelligence, the ability to experience pleasure, nurturance of self and others, and the ability to change. 

On the other hand, imbalances in this chakra can lead to rigidity in body and attitudes, frigidity or fear of sex, poor social skills, denial of pleasure, excessive boundaries, fear of change, lack of desire, passion, excitement, sexual acting out, pleasure addiction, excessively strong emotions, poor boundaries, seductive manipulation, emotional dependency, and obsessive attachment.

Physical malfunctions associated with the Second Chakra include disorders of reproductive organs, spleen, urinary system, menstrual difficulties, sexual dysfunction, low back pain, knee trouble, lack of flexibility, deadened senses, loss of appetite for food, sex, and life. 

Healing practices for this chakra involve movement therapy, emotional release or containment as appropriate, inner child work, boundary work, 12-step programs for addictions, assigning healthy pleasures, and developing sensate intelligence. 

Affirmations that can help balance the Second Chakra include "I deserve pleasure in my life," "I absorb information from my feelings," "I embrace and celebrate my sexuality," "My sexuality is sacred," "I move easily and effortlessly," and "Life is pleasurable."

### BASIC ISSUES 

The second chakra, also known as the sacral chakra or svadhisthana, is located in the lower abdomen and is associated with change, movement, flow, sensation, pleasure, emotion, need, desire, the shadow, guilt, duality, and sexuality. It is the center of our emotional body and governs our ability to experience and express emotions, as well as our capacity for pleasure and sensuality.

- **Change**: The second chakra represents the ability to adapt and evolve in response to external stimuli.
- **Movement**: This chakra is associated with fluidity, flexibility, and ease of movement.
- **Flow**: The second chakra promotes a sense of balance and harmony within our emotional body.
- **Sensation**: This chakra is responsible for our ability to experience pleasure through the senses.
- **Pleasure**: The second chakra is associated with the pursuit of pleasure and fulfillment. 
- **Emotion**: This chakra governs our emotional well-being and helps us process and express our emotions in a healthy way.
- **Need**: The second chakra is connected to our basic needs for safety, security, and belonging. 
- **Desire**: This chakra represents our innate desire for growth, expansion, and fulfillment. 

The second chakra can also be associated with the shadow side of our personality, which includes negative emotions such as fear, guilt, and shame. By becoming aware of these shadows, we can work towards healing and integration.

This chakra is often linked to feelings of guilt and self-judgment. It encourages us to take responsibility for our actions and to develop a healthier relationship with ourselves and others.

The second chakra represents the dual nature of reality, which includes both light and dark, good and evil, pleasure and pain. By embracing this duality, we can cultivate a more balanced and integrated sense of self.

This chakra is closely associated with sexual energy and desire. It encourages us to explore our sexuality in a healthy and fulfilling way, while also promoting greater intimacy and connection with others.

### DIVING IN THE WATERS

* Diving into the waters represents a mythical journey of non-being and rebirth through baptism.
* Entering the second chakra involves exploring emotions, sexuality, and shifting from earth to water as an element.
* Change is essential for consciousness to find stimulation and expansion.
* Emotional fulfillment comes from balancing emotional flow and containment within the body's sensate and structural forms.
* The first chakra provides support and containment for the fluid essence of the second chakra, like a cup holding water.
* Balance is key in the second chakra to allow for filling, holding, and emptying of emotions.

#### LETTING GO TO MOVEMENT

1. In the second chakra, our challenge is to let go and flow, move, feel, and yield. Movement and change stimulate consciousness. They stir the watery essence of feelings that flow through the body.
2. On the physical plane, movement literally gets us up off our butts, where we rise from the anchor of chakra one and expand outward. Movement extends our field of perception, increasing our sensory input.
3. Through our senses, we differentiate between pleasure and pain, expand or contract, move forward or backward, react or enact. When there is pain or emptiness, our senses shut down.
4. Pleasure invites us to pay attention to our senses, live fully in the present, enjoy the experience of being alive. It dispels stress, makes us more receptive to new ideas, and enhances enthusiasm about life.
5. Pleasure invites us to integrate something while pain pushes us to separate and disown. 
6. Our culture equates maturity with the ability to deny pleasure. We are often told to put our pleasures away as we grow older—to sit still, work hard, deny or control our feelings.
7. When pleasure is denied, an essential part of our second chakra program never gets installed. This creates a person who is missing a vital ingredient to wholeness but does not know what it is, how to find it, or even that it is missing. The result is rigidity in the body and disconnection from the outer world.
8. Boundary issues are prevalent in each of the lower three chakras when primary, healthy pleasures are denied. Secondary pleasures take over, such as the pleasure of drinking, drugs, avoiding responsibility, sexually acting out, or overeating.

#### EMOTIONS

1. Emotion is the chief source of all becoming conscious and transforming darkness into light and apathy into movement without emotion.
2. Emotions are instinctual reactions to sensory data, feelings are unconscious reactions to this information, and emotions are the way we organize our feelings.
3. Without consciousness, emotions govern our reactions; we may get angry, fall in or out of love, feel depressed or afraid, but these emotions generally arise from the depths of our psyche quite of their own accord.
4. Emotions have a spiritual function as the language of the soul and are spoken through the body.
5. Most therapies focus strongly on emotions; pervasive feelings of fear, frustration, shame, or anxiety initiate the quest for change and the beginnings of transformation.
6. Emotions are subconscious organizations of impulses to move away from harm and toward pleasure; it is difficult to feel emotions without some kind of movement.
7. Releasing emotions frees the body, while freeing emotions by consciously moving the body restores aliveness and motility.

#### THE SHADOW

1. The second chakra produces the first major change of consciousness, representing duality and polarity.
2. One of the tasks of second chakra adult development is to integrate previously polarized or one-sided aspects of our personality into an indivisible whole.
3. The shadow represents repressed instinctual energies that are locked away in the realm of the unconscious, not dying but no longer part of conscious awareness.
4. Repression of the shadow requires a great deal of energy and robs the whole of its grace and power.
5. The shadow chases us in our dreams, sabotages work and relationships, and energizes compulsive activities when repressed.
6. Repression will always call forth compensatory counter activity of the unconscious which will force upon us the very thing we are trying to repress.
7. Reclaiming the shadow dissolves judgment and brings greater acceptance of self and others, restoring an essential wholeness.
8. Repressed elements of our personality can degenerate into something unpleasant without expression, while reclaiming the shadow means channeling instinctual energies in appropriate ways.

#### GUILT

1. Guilt is associated with the second chakra because it hinders the free flow of movement and takes pleasure out of experiences.
2. When someone feels guilty about their actions, they do not fully enjoy them and cannot sense the experience as a whole.
3. Compulsive activities are often driven by the pleasure principle, but guilt prevents satisfaction, leading to repetition.
4. Guilt keeps the shadow in its dark and unconscious realm, making it more insistent and requiring tighter control from the prison guard.
5. Guilt polarizes the personality, dividing light against dark and good against bad, resulting in either-or thinking.
6. Developing the ability to feel is crucial in discerning subtle nuances between polarities, as numb feelings only allow for obvious differences.
7. Guilt can be healthy when used as feedback to guide behavior and make changes, but it becomes a demon when excessive, habitual, internalized, and toxic.

#### SEXUALITY

1. Sexuality is the ultimate expression of the second chakra's issues: movement, sensation, pleasure, desire, emotions, and polarity. It is the resolution of difference, the union of opposites, and the connecting experience that transcends isolation and forms the foundation for the next chakra level: power.
2. Sexuality incorporates Eros, the basic force of attraction, which is an ancient god in Hindu mythology (Kama). Eros unites and delights, bridges and soothes, holding the universe together.
3. To embrace Eros is to have the capacity for surrender and flow with the biological nature of the instinctual/emotional body.
4. Sexuality is the ecstatic expression of that force, but it has been massively misunderstood by our culture. The wounds of mismanaged sexuality are deep and pervasive, affecting the natural flow of excitation through the body.
5. Guilt, as a demon of the second chakra, is a direct antidote to pleasure and self-esteem. It has been poured through the sexual gates, locking the essential gateway to pleasure and transformation.
6. Sexuality is rejected and sent to the realm of the shadow, where it takes on its demonic form of dissociation and perpetration, desperately seeking connection at any cost.
7. To reclaim the second chakra is to reclaim our right to feel and our right to healthy sexuality.
8. A balanced second chakra has the capacity for sexual satisfaction, physical pleasure, general enjoyment of life, comfort with intimacy, and the ability to accept movement and change gracefully, including graceful physical movements. There is steadiness and clarity in emotional states.
9. Balance involves the ability to nurture self and others while still maintaining healthy sexual and emotional boundaries. 
10. The qualifications for healthy sexuality can only be decided by the persons in question; however, general guidelines include consenting adults, mutual enhancement, integration with one's life, and stimulation of growth.

### GROWING THE LOTUS 
#### DEVELOPMENTAL FORMATION OF THE SECOND CHAKRA

1. Age range: 6 months to 2 years
2. Tasks: Sensate exploration of the world; Locomotion; Separation from symbiotic fusion
3. Needs and issues: Separation vs. attachment; Safety and support to explore; Emotional security; Stimulating environment; Self-gratification
4. Second chakra stage development:   
 - Increased alertness at 6 months
 - Discovery of the external world shatters blissful psychic unity
 - Child is plunged into a world of duality
 - Delighting his senses becomes the child's driving interest
 - Important to have an environment that brings pleasure to the child as he explores
 - Touch, comfort, and nurturance give security and connectedness
 - Lack of touch is experienced as separation anxiety
 - Can the child learn to trust his own senses? Are his feelings mirrored appropriately? Is he protected from danger?
 - Emotional climate of the family is a crucial influence at this stage
 - Somatic experiences become hardwired into the system
 - Language of emotions is being programmed through responsive mirroring

Tasks of this developmental stage: Develop sensate connection between inner and outer world, provide bonding and supportive emotional environment for closeness and separation, create feeling of pleasure and connection with body, awaken developing consciousness through sensory stimulation.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES 

#### TACTILE AND SENSATE DEPRIVATION

1. Tactile and sensate deprivation can lead to soul wounds and difficulty connecting with oneself or understanding what one really wants in life.
2. When body identity is not affirmed through touch, it may be replaced by a frozen image, leading to a split between the sixth and second chakra.
3. Lack of touch can result in autoerotic stimulation such as habitual rocking, compulsive masturbation, and eating disorders.
4. If the senses do not logically flow from experience, the child may learn to distrust her own senses.
5. When we distrust our senses, we shut them down, leading to difficulty in telling whether one is hungry or full, tired or in danger, overstimulated or coming down with a cold.

#### SEXUAL ABUSE

1. Sexual abuse hits at the very core of the second chakra and has long-lasting effects on all aspects of the second chakra.
2. It affects our sense of trust, experience of power (or lack thereof), future relationships, ability to communicate, and more.
3. Sexual abuse comprises anything that does not respect the natural development of a child's sexuality.
4. The younger such an event occurs, the more devastating its effects.
5. Stimulation of erogenous zones is meant to dissolve boundaries, but early childhood development is oriented toward developing an ego that can make boundaries and distinctions.
6. Sexual abuse can produce emotional numbness, various addictions, eating disorders, phobias, sexual dysfunction, guilt and shame, depression, hostility, dependency, sleep disorders, psychosomatic disorders, and many other difficulties with life.
7. Abortion halts the natural process of the body geared toward continuing the pregnancy, and it takes time to heal from this wound.

Anything that blocks development of the second chakra severs two essential connections: the internal connection between mind and body, and the external connection that joins inner and outer worlds, self and other, soul and environment.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE THE ORAL: THE LOVER

The Oral character is a person who has experienced deprivation during their early developmental stages, particularly in terms of nourishment and physical contact. This can lead to an undernourished child who grows up to be dependent, addictive, and needy as an adult. 

The Oral character often seeks dependence and merging with others as a defense against deprivation, and their focus of energy is fixated outside themselves. They may struggle with low energy levels, depression, and difficulty forming boundaries.

Oral Character - Lover Personality
a. When loved, feels energized and whole; loyal partner who is perceptive and understanding.
 b. Bonds well and loves deeply, but can be hurt easily when relationships end.
 c. Clinging dependency drives people away, perpetuating the problem of rejection.

Oral Character - Service to Others
a. Perk up when interacting with others; find definition through service to others.
b. This defense can be a trap as it may lead to codependence and exhaustion from constant giving.
c. Breaking the cycle involves learning to nourish oneself physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY

**Excess**: intense emotional states, difficulty separating one's own feelings from those of others, social dependency, addiction to people and partying, craving constant stimulation, excessive sexuality, and a weak boundary container.

**Deficiency**: restricted movement physically, emotionally, and sexually; rigid or jerky motions, stiff joints, and a rigid musculature that has trouble yielding to softness and feeling; difficulty bending the knees and pelvis; restricted flow of excitation through the body; low breathing and metabolic rate; diminished emotions; fear of change; monopolarization of ideas; rigidity in boundaries; belief that if we let feelings flow, we will fall down the rabbit hole with nothing to support us; difficulty sensing one's own needs; lack of pleasure; repressed, diminished, or nonexistent sexual feelings; shame around sex; contraction in the social realm.

#### Addictions

Alcohol lessens inhibiting control of the conscious mind, allowing liberating current to move unhindered toward the crown, releasing energy and discharging the system. 

Excessive eating may be an attempt to ground, create pleasure, or block anger in the third chakra.

**Treatment of Addictions**: Reroute cyclic repetitive patterns, discharge underlying emotional force, reconnect with sensations of the body, discharge and/or learn to contain pervading emotions, complete blocked movements frozen by trauma, and learn to appropriately meet needs.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS

In order to heal the second chakra, one must first understand the nature of emotions and sexuality in our culture. It is important to recognize that healing this chakra involves more than just personal work; it also requires addressing societal issues and cultural norms.

The second chakra is associated with emotions, sexuality, and creativity. It is located in the lower abdomen, near the genitals. When this chakra is balanced, one feels a sense of pleasure, joy, and creativity. However, when it is out of balance, one may experience feelings of guilt, shame, or fear around emotions and sexuality.

One common technique for healing the second chakra is to encourage movement and emotion. When there is a blockage in this area, it can lead to stagnation and a lack of flow. By encouraging movement and emotion, one can help to restore balance and promote healing. This can be done through various forms of exercise or movement therapy, as well as through expressing emotions in a safe and healthy way.

Another technique for healing the second chakra is to work on developing a sense of boundaries and self-worth. When there is an imbalance in this area, it can lead to feelings of guilt or shame around sexuality and emotions. 

#### WORKING THROUGH GUILT

1. Identify the external factors that may have affected your actions.
2. Understand what you were trying to accomplish or satisfy.
3. Look for ways that the behavior was modeled for you.
4. See how underlying needs can be more directly and appropriately filled.
5. Take stock of any harm caused and find ways of making amends.
6. Develop strategies to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
7. Let go of guilt and focus on positive actions.

If you struggle with guilt over innocent behaviors, examine your belief system by asking questions about the values behind those beliefs. Healthy guilt is an emotional response to behaving in a manner contrary to our beliefs and values.

#### EMOTIONAL WORK: RECLAIMING OUR RIGHT TO FEEL

Learn to see emotions as natural responses to situations that affect us.

Emotions related to abuse can be overwhelming and conflicting, such as intense longing and betrayal, simultaneous urges to reach out and withdraw, expansive anger and contracting fear, and strong emotions at some times and numbness at others.

The energy of an emotion can be channeled into appropriate movements or activities, such as using anger to clean house when angry and feeling grief through writing poetry.

Emotional release does not always bring healing, but can be beneficial in some cases where simple catharsis brings profound healing and transformation.

Change is movement, and in order to create change there has to be both internal and external movement in the body.

Blocked emotion is bound into the structure of the body; exaggerating unconscious movements and their attendant feelings can bring them into consciousness.

Containment means embracing our excitement bodily, letting feelings unfold within our containing body, and allowing ourselves to be formed by these feelings.

Energy follows habitual paths of expression, and containment invites the creation of alternative paths.

Containment means allowing energy to fill up our tissues, expand our sensation, and build our excitement.

#### SEXUAL HEALING—COURTING EROS

**Sexual healing** - become intimate with the subtle nuances of the inner self; and addressing energy patterns in the body armor.

**Eros** - Eros is the binding element par excellence that bridges fact and value together, and it binds being and becoming. It requires a balance between containment and flow to address mechanical sexual dysfunctions such as impotence, inability to reach orgasm, or premature ejaculation.

**Sexual healing and Eros** - Sexual healing involves moving from the mechanical activity of sex into the numinous quality of Eros by reweaving the union of sexuality and Eros and bringing sex back into the realm of the divine. 

**Sexual healing and chakras** - The relationship to the health of our bodies (chakra one), a healthy ego and sense of power (chakra three), healthy relationships with open hearts and clear communication (chakra five), imagination (chakra six), and experiencing sex as a spiritual union (seventh chakra) all play a role in sexual healing.

**Sexual healing and the sacred** - Sexual healing brings the sacred back into the sexual act, restoring wholeness through the unfolding of pleasure, and nourishing the soul in preparation for the journey across the Rainbow Bridge.

### CONCLUSION

* The second chakra is the prime mover of energy in the chakra system.
* As vital forces begin their journey upward, the soul is carried on the currents of emotion and desire toward growth.
* A secure base allows us to yield to the inner flow of prana (vital energy) without losing our center.
* The second chakra is analogous to the water element, which makes things grow, move, and change.

## CHAKRA THREE

Chakra Three, also known as Manipura or the Solar Plexus Chakra, is the center of personal power, transformation, and self-esteem. Located in the solar plexus region, it is associated with the element of fire and has a yellow color. 

The primary purpose of Chakra Three is transformation. It enables us to transform our energy into action and activity, allowing us to take control of our lives and make decisions independently. This chakra also helps us develop our willpower, which is essential for achieving our goals and overcoming obstacles. Additionally, it contributes to the development of self-esteem, as we learn to value ourselves and our abilities.

However, imbalances in Chakra Three can lead to various issues, such as low energy, weak will, poor self-discipline, and low self-esteem. These deficiencies may result from traumatic experiences like shaming, authoritarianism, volatile situations, or physical abuse. Excessive activation of this chakra, on the other hand, can manifest as overly aggressive behavior, a need to be right, manipulative tendencies, and an unhealthy obsession with power.

To maintain balance in Chakra Three, it is essential to engage in healing practices that promote self-esteem, willpower, and autonomy. This includes risk-taking activities (for deficiency), grounding and emotional contact, deep relaxation, stress control, vigorous exercise, martial arts, sit-ups, and psychotherapy focused on building ego strength, releasing or containing anger, working on shame issues, strengthening the will, and encouraging autonomy.

### SHADES OF YELLOW

1. **Where do we get power from?** We acquire power through various means such as training, education, and socialization, where it is often seen in terms of "eat or be eaten," "control or be controlled," "winners or losers," and "one up or one down.

2. **How do we use power?** Power can be used for both positive and negative purposes. In the inner world, people often think that gaining power involves fighting their inferior parts with the strength of their superior parts. 

4. **Why do we need power?** People often seek power as a way to gain control over their lives. However, this pursuit of power can lead to a self-defeating cycle of conflict and struggle.

5. **How can we avoid the unbalanced duality of power?** To reclaim our power, we need to enter into an entirely new dynamic and define it in terms of transformation, and embracing a more inclusive and multi-dimensional perspective that emphasizes combination and synergy between different aspects of ourselves.

### UNFOLDING THE PETALS

The third chakra, also known as the solar plexus chakra or manipura, is a vital energy center in the human body that plays a significant role in our overall well-being and personal growth.

**Activity**: The third chakra helps us to maintain a healthy balance between rest and activity, ensuring that we have the necessary energy to pursue our goals and aspirations.

**Autonomy**: When this chakra is balanced, we feel confident in making decisions for ourselves and taking responsibility for our actions. We are able to stand up for what we believe in and assert our boundaries without feeling guilty or ashamed.

**Authority**: When this chakra is balanced, we have the confidence and self-assurance needed to take on leadership roles and make decisions that benefit ourselves and others. We are able to use our power wisely and ethically.

**Individuation**: When this chakra is balanced, we have a strong sense of self-identity and are able to express ourselves authentically without fear of judgment or rejection.

**Will**: When this chakra is balanced, we have the strength and resilience needed to overcome adversity and achieve success.

**Self-Esteem**: When this chakra is balanced, we have a healthy sense of self-respect and confidence in our abilities. We are able to accept compliments and praise without feeling guilty or ashamed, and we are able to set boundaries with others without feeling guilty or ashamed.

**Shame**: When this chakra is out of balance, we may feel ashamed or guilty about our actions, even when they were not our fault. We may also struggle with low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in ourselves and our abilities.

**Proactivity**: When this chakra is balanced, we are able to take initiative and make things happen in our lives. We are not afraid to take risks or try new things, even if they may be challenging or uncomfortable.

**Power**: When this chakra is balanced, we have a healthy sense of personal power and are able to use it wisely and ethically. We are able to assert ourselves without being aggressive or domineering, and we are able to stand up for what we believe in without feeling guilty or ashamed.

#### ENERGY AND ACTIVITY

A strong grounding allows for the conversion of energy into action.

A healthy third chakra exhibits energetic vitality, enjoyment, and enthusiasm for life.

Personal power gives hope in making things viable for oneself.

Activity develops a sense of power through constant presentation of new challenges.

#### AUTONOMY

* Autonomy is essential for personal responsibility and taking ownership of one's actions.

* Lack of autonomy leads to blaming others, preventing personal growth and change.

A balanced relationship involves separate beings who retain their individuality while coming together by choice and will, in freedom and wholeness. Lack of autonomy often leads to blaming others for one's problems, preventing individuals from taking responsibility for their lives and making necessary changes.

#### INDIVIDUATION

Individuation: Carl Jung's term for the soul's journey towards realization and wholeness.

- Reclaim shadow, inner masculine/feminine, mythic/archetypal energies: Integrate undeveloped aspects into a comprehensive Self.
- Third chakra: Ego awakens, differentiates from outer expectations, becomes willed enactment.
- Individuation process: Cannot be grasped in essence; includes mystery of transformation and secret of life.
- Individuation unfolds unique destiny, unfolding of the soul; cannot change world without individuating.
- C.G. Jung: Individuation begins in heart chakra with integration of inner masculine/feminine (animus/anima), but I believe it starts with third chakra birth of psychic autonomy.
- Many people do not awaken this chakra, remain in less differentiated aspects of lower chakras, and lack true psychic freedom due to damage or lack of developmental completion.

#### EGO IDENTITY

The ego manages the division between conscious and unconscious, interior and exterior, and operates the gates between the many worlds of the Self.

According to Carl Jung, the ego is the conscious element of the Self, which does not necessarily include our unconscious hopes and dreams, fantasies, and fears. Since the ego is by definition unaware of the unconscious, it is not the center of the whole Self but acts as an operating principle, combining inner and outer experience. 

The ego functions as an executive identity or CEO of the Self, sorting out which impulses to express or repress and orienting the movement of our energy toward a goal. It creates defenses to protect the vulnerable core Self and develops strategies and behaviors to meet the needs of that core self as it grows and develops.

The ego also organizes consciousness towards self-definition, requiring ego strength to integrate diverse and difficult experiences while maintaining consistency in the Self. 

However, the ego divides as well as unites, creating a division between conscious and unconscious, between shadow elements of the lower chakras and the developing persona that emerges in the fourth chakra.

Individuation is an expansion of the Self beyond the realms of the ego, yet the ego is necessary to anchor this growth. The word “ego” is a combination of the Greek roots for “I” (e) and “earth” (go), making it the grounded self, the individualized roots of consciousness. It is like a house that contains us, gives us a place to grow and change, and creates boundaries, which are necessary for forming ourselves as an entity.

Many spiritual disciplines advise us to transcend the ego, considering it something bad, limiting, or false. However, the problem with the ego is not that it is limiting but that we let ourselves be confined by it at all times. We stay confined out of fear, guilt, or shame and never go outside to the larger world, never open our windows and doors. It is not wrong to have a home, but it should be an anchor for experience, not a limitation. Keeping this in perspective enables us to both have a strong ego and transcend it as well.

#### WILL

- Many people live their lives according to what they are "supposed" to do without questioning the source of these suppositions.
- The human will is a combination of desire and consciousness, which gives it direction and form through intentionality.
- Willfulness does not necessarily lead to selfishness; rather, it is important to maintain a balance between personal desires and cooperation with others.
- The third chakra, located in the softest part of the torso, supports the body's alignment and vitality when self-esteem is high and the will is strong.

#### SELF-ESTEEM

* Self-esteem is essential for personal growth, energetic vitality, and healthy ego development.
* High self-esteem allows individuals to make mistakes without feeling shame or paralysis.
* Shame as a state of being can be toxic and dehumanizing if it becomes an identity.
* Proactivity is the ability to choose one's actions and take responsibility for shaping the future, rather than reacting to circumstances.

#### POWER

1. *Power* is the ability to make change and exists for one reason only—transformation. It is a process of becoming real.
2. Power comes when we are willing to make mistakes, be responsible for them, learn from them, and correct them.
3. Power is the expression of the sacred in its evolutionary unfolding; it is the awesome presence of the divine.
4. Power is the mystery, the unknown, the confrontation with the other. It is the transition from the past to the future.
5. To reclaim our power, we must approach the magnificent expanse of totality and determine our own destiny.
6. Power begins with what is; it involves earth, water, movement, and emotions as fuel for transformation.

### GROWING THE LOTUS

The third chakra, also known as the solar plexus chakra, is responsible for personal power, self-esteem, and confidence. During the age range of 18 months to 4 years, children undergo significant development in their emotional, physical, and cognitive abilities. This stage is marked by the growth of the lotus formation of the third chakra, which involves several key tasks, needs, and issues.

#### Tasks:
1. Development of autonomy: Children at this age are learning to become more independent and assertive in their actions and decisions.
2. Development of language: Language skills rapidly improve during this stage, as children learn to communicate their thoughts and feelings more effectively.
3. Impulse control: Children at this age are learning to regulate their impulses and emotions, which is crucial for developing self-control and social skills.
4. Mastery of holding on and letting go: As children learn to hold onto objects and let go of them when necessary, they develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.
5. Toilet training: This is a significant milestone in the development of autonomy and self-care skills. 
6. Self-definition: During this stage, children begin to develop a sense of self and identity, which includes exploring their interests, talents, and preferences.

#### Needs and Issues:
1. Appropriate discipline: Children at this age require consistent and appropriate discipline to help them learn self-control and respect for others.
2. Support of autonomy: Encouraging children's independence and allowing them to make choices within reasonable limits is crucial for their development of a strong sense of self.
3. Confidence and encouragement: Children at this age need positive feedback and support from caregivers to build confidence in their abilities and develop a healthy self-esteem.
4. Play: Engaging in playful activities with children helps them develop social skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. It also provides an opportunity for bonding and learning through fun experiences.

#### I was a single mother when my son was in his third chakra stage 

1. The challenge of this stage is to develop impulse control, which is crucial for self-esteem, personal autonomy, and a strong will.
2. The child must now internalize appropriate limits, which occurs through internalization of language.
3. As these concepts get established, there may be a lot of testing going on that helps the child establish the language-action connection.
4. The ego becomes the mediator between the shadow and the developing persona, sorting through impulses and instincts coming up from the lower chakras.
5. Toilet training involves learning to control muscles previously allowed to respond in the moment.
6. Holding on and letting go are fundamental energetic principles that establish patterns for life.
7. The successful handling of this stage gives us the distinctly third chakra characteristics of power and will.
8. If autonomy is thwarted at this crucial stage, the individuation process gets bound up in either resistance or submission and never fully develops.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

* Loss of Power: People are expected to accept treatment as an essential part of life without questioning it, leading to a culture obsessed with power outside themselves.
* Numbness and Emptiness: The emptiness inside ourselves leads us to seek power externally through the approval of others, technological gadgets, or a distant god.
* Regaining Power: To regain our power, we must understand how it was taken away and focus on thriving rather than curtailing our own expansion.

#### AUTHORITY

* Authority is a concept that has been passed down through generations, where individuals believed in the ultimate authority of God over man, man over woman, and parent over child. Children were seen as inferior and expected to be quiet and obedient.
* People spend years in therapy trying to recover from self-negating beliefs they thought were true, such as their own badness or that they deserved such treatment.
* Authority is present in everyone's life, influencing how we respond to it and shaping our concept of power. We need inner authority to command our lives and make decisions.
* The inner King represents the part of us that knows what we want and makes it clear to ourselves and others. It can be influenced by the behavior of those who held authority over us, leading to either tyrannical or wimpish inner authority.
* To examine the influence of authority in your own life, consider the central authority figure during childhood, their methods, how you felt about them, and whether you obeyed out of respect or fear. Reflect on how this has shaped your inner authority and how it can be brought into better alignment with your life.

#### PUNISHMENT

- When authority is won through respect, it resonates with our inner truth and invites us to willingly participate because we believe in the reason and purpose behind it. 
- However, when authority tells us to go against our own nature, it resonates with something deeper—fear. 
- Fear regresses our third chakra will to the first chakra level of survival, causing us to move backward in reaction rather than forward in action.
- Punishment is used by authority for controlling behavior and robbing us of our free will.
- Starhawk lists four basic ways we can respond to punishment: comply, rebel, withdraw, or manipulate. To habitually comply or withdraw is to be deficient; to automatically rebel or manipulate is to be excessive.
- Compliance is a false citadel of power, while authenticity is the jewel. Denying our authenticity is antithetical to building healthy ego strength.

#### THE PARENTIFIED CHILD

1. The parentified child is a term used to describe a child who takes on adult responsibilities within the family due to various circumstances such as substance abuse, poverty, illness, death or divorce.
2. This role can include emotional support for the remaining parent, raising younger siblings, earning money for the family, giving up childhood freedoms and social life with peers, and even relating with a parent sexually.
3. The expectation that the child can fulfill these roles is often inappropriate due to their biological and emotional immaturity, leading to feelings of inadequacy.
4. This sense of inadequacy not only affects future tasks but also one's concept of self, which can be turned around by recognizing the inappropriateness of these expectations and working through the associated feelings.
5. The feelings of inadequacy can arise even when support seems adequate.

#### OVERSTIMULATION AND SENSORY DEPRIVATION

Overstimulation - Third chakra receives more energy than it can handle; children may become hypersensitive or hyperactive.

Sensory deprivation - Understimulated child experiences emptiness, fear, and fatigue; feels most energized in situations with strong stimulation.

#### SHAMING

1. Shame intensifies both control and release dynamics, making them more rigidly demanding and self-destructive.
2. Shame results from various forms of child abuse, leading the child to believe they are at fault for the abuse.
3. Parental shaming can occur through statements like "You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" or failure to praise a child's accomplishments.
4. Unacknowledged parental shame is passed down to children, causing them to feel ashamed when they fail to meet their parents' expectations.
5. Shame collapses the third chakra and affects breathing, perception, understanding, and alignment of the head with the rest of the body.
6. Shame creates a block between the mind and the body, splitting one off from the core self, leading to feelings of inferiority and self-fulfilling prophecies.

#### BROKEN WILL

1. The willful child is more challenging to raise than the obedient one due to their energy and desire to do many things.
2. Parents' emotions can be disabled by shame, leading to a frozen energy that blocks the mind-will interaction.

John Bradshaw emphasizes the importance of parents providing guiding principles and final authority for the child's safety and well-being.

Parents who are too busy may not be aware of their child's natural rhythms, leading to a smooth-running ship and breaking the child's will.

Breaking the will of the child can create people who act without feeling, enthusiasm, or a healthy sense of power.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE THE ENDURER

- The Endurer's Dilemma: activity that cannot move forward turned against self, creating more frustration, tension, blockage; results in morose feeling of hopelessness and despair, disabled will, reduced energy level.
- Since authority is forced at a time when autonomy is naturally emerging but not strong enough to stand alone, submission is the only possible recourse.
- This results in pattern of outer compliance and inner defiance.
- The Endurer feels both manipulated by and angry toward person he wants affection from; feels both need and anger simultaneously, unable to express either.
- Greatest fear of Endurer is humiliation; when punished or criticized, often collapses into vicious self-recrimination known as shame attack.
- This diminishes third chakra, making it more difficult to protect himself.
- Becomes ashamed of what is inside, translates to shame about everything inside—feelings, thoughts, needs, essentially his very self.
- Greatest fear of Endurer is exposure, certain will lead to humiliation and further shame.
- Blocks in legs, hands, throat, genitals; unable to release energy, creates buildup inside, often making body dense and large with thick muscular padding between throat and buttocks.
- To heal, Endurer needs to express both angry and tender feelings; movement breaks holding patterns, sexuality allows nurturance to come in.
- Building self-esteem is underlying theme, so larger ego can stand up to inner critic and emerge into autonomy once again.

### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY EXCESS

1. **Excessive third chakra**: A life dominated by doing and achievement, compensating for feelings of diminished or unrecognized power. Overcompensation with power, control, and bolstering one's self-esteem. Constant activity, human doing instead of being, chronic pushing leading to chronic fatigue.
2. **Excessive will**: Rigid, lacks flexibility, may flare in anger or retreat in fear when challenged. Constant need for control over oneself, others, and situations. Extreme bully or manager who obsesses about every detail.
3. **Deficient third chakra**: Lack of fire and vitality, poor self-discipline, weak will, lack of spontaneity. Easily manipulated by others, frequent depression, energy held back by feelings of shame. Passive, avoidance of confrontation, letting others take the lead.
4. **Third chakra deficiency and stimulants**: Attracted to caffeine, amphetamines, or cocaine for feeling normal or continuing constant activity. Highly anxious personalities may be attracted to calming drugs like opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS

In order to restore the Lotus Healing the Third Chakra, it is essential to address both internal energy management within the body and external expression of that energy in the outer world simultaneously. 

This involves overcoming existing inertia, which can be achieved through various methods such as building up metabolic energy by paying attention to diet and engaging in frequent aerobic exercise. 

Additionally, challenging oneself with activities that provide nourishment and support while also confronting fears and shame can help increase one's energy levels and overall sense of power and control. 

#### deficient third chakras

work on strengthening their will by increasing physical energy as well as paying conscious attention to their goals and desires. 

#### excessive third chakras 

may require relaxation techniques such as guided meditation or yoga to help dissolve blocks that bind tension and promote a deeper state of being. 

#### OTHER GENERAL STRATEGIES FOR THIRD CHAKRA HEALING

1. Give up being safe: To develop third chakra power, one must let go of the desire for safety and accept that there will be challenges, criticism, misunderstanding, rejection, or failure. 
2. Work with anger: Blocked anger can lead to excessive or deficient conditions, but expressing it can improve metabolism and stabilize weight problems.
3. Attack the shame demon: Shame often lurks in the shadows of the third chakra, undermining self-esteem. Compassion for one's inner child can also help dissipate shame.
4. Inner child dialogues: Having an adult self talk to the child self in a compassionate manner can replace overly critical, shaming programs that run us ragged and steal joy from our lives.

### CONCLUSION

*Third chakra work* involves building ego strength through contact with the authentic self, raising self-esteem, creating a sense of power, and releasing inhibitions.

To achieve this, one should make a list of goals and intentions, plan steps to bring them into manifestation, and apply energy to these goals or other routines that develop skills and physical energy.

The results of efforts positively reinforce the process and ground third chakra power in tangible reality.

Healing the third chakra brings a healthy sense of power with its limits, promoting a proactive and causative approach to life.

This approach is confident, warm, responsible, and persevering, allowing one to take on challenges, follow through on tasks, confront opposition effectively, and take responsibility for their actions.

A person with a healthy third chakra has good vitality and a playful ability to laugh at themselves.

## CHAKRA FOUR 

The Fourth Chakra, also known as the Heart Chakra or Anahata, is located at the center of the chest near the heart and cardiac plexus. It is associated with the element of air and has a green color. This chakra's primary purpose is to facilitate love and balance in our lives, both internally and externally.

The Fourth Chakra deals with issues related to love, balance, self-love, relationships, intimacy, anima/animus, devotion, reaching out, and taking in. It is essential for individuals to maintain a healthy balance within this chakra to foster positive relationships and emotional well-being.

The developmental stage of the Fourth Chakra typically occurs between 4 to 7 years old, during which children begin forming peer and family relationships while developing their persona. The basic rights associated with this chakra include the right to love and be loved.

When balanced, the Fourth Chakra leads to compassionate, loving, empathetic, self-loving, altruistic, peaceful, and balanced individuals who have a good immune system. However, when imbalanced or traumatized, it can lead to antisocial, withdrawn, cold, critical, judgmental, intolerant, lonely, isolated, depressed, fearful of intimacy, lack of empathy, narcissistic, codependent, poor boundaries, demanding, clinging, jealous, overly sacrificing, and physical malfunctions such as disorders of the heart, lungs, thymus, breasts, arms, shortness of breath, sunken chest, circulation problems, asthma, immune system deficiency, tension between shoulder blades, and pain in the chest.

Healing practices for the Fourth Chakra include breathing exercises, pranayama, working with arms, reaching out, taking in, journaling, self-discovery, psychotherapy, examining assumptions about relationships, emotional release of grief, forgiveness when appropriate, inner child work, and codependency work. Affirmations such as "I am worthy of love," "I am loving to myself and others," and "There is an infinite supply of love" can also be helpful in maintaining a balanced Fourth Chakra.

### SHADES OF GREEN

1. Love is a basic human right that is simple yet profound. It is essential for the heart chakra to function properly.
2. Love is an archetypal experience that runs our lives and drives us to seek connection with others.
3. The absence of healthy love can lead to travesties, such as child abuse, which are not complete absences of love but twisted versions of it.
4. Without knowing what healthy love looks like, it is difficult to create it in one's life.
5. Our culture has turned away from love and towards warfare and violence, which is reflected in television violence and gang behavior.
6. The Great Mother archetype represents nurturance, nourishment, containment, and connection, but she has been forgotten in Western civilization's dominant mythology.
7. The absence of the Great Mother archetype has led to a broken home mythos, where we are seen as motherless children living with an estranged father.
8. Our predominant myth is one of separation, which creates divisions between individuals and groups based on race, class, gender, and age.
9. Love is culturally restricted to limited heterosexual dyads and their offspring, leading to a flawed model that does not address the needs of all people.
10. To heal the heart chakra and reconnect with love, we must recognize our own divine nature and integrate mind, body, mystical, and mundane aspects of ourselves.

### UNFOLDING THE PETALS

The Fourth Chakra, also known as the Heart Chakra, is a crucial aspect of human development and spiritual growth. It encompasses various themes such as love, balance, self-reflection, self-acceptance, relationships, intimacy, anima/animus, eros/thanatos, grief, compassion, and devotion.

1. **Love**: The Fourth Chakra is primarily associated with the emotion of love. It encourages individuals to cultivate a deep sense of unconditional love for themselves and others.
2. **Balance**: Maintaining balance in life is essential for overall well-being. The Fourth Chakra promotes harmony between the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of an individual. 
3. **Self-Reflection**: The Heart Chakra emphasizes self-reflection as a means of personal growth. By taking time for introspection, individuals can gain insight into their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. 
4. **Self-Acceptance**: The Fourth Chakra encourages individuals to embrace all aspects of themselves, including their strengths, weaknesses, and imperfections.
5. **Relationships**: The Heart Chakra plays a significant role in forming and maintaining healthy relationships with others. It promotes empathy, compassion, and understanding, enabling individuals to connect deeply with their loved ones.
6. **Intimacy**: The Fourth Chakra is associated with intimacy on both physical and emotional levels. It encourages individuals to explore their sexuality in a healthy and fulfilling manner while also fostering deep emotional connections with others.
7. **Anima/Animus**: The Heart Chakra is connected to the archetypes of anima (feminine) and animus (masculine). These concepts represent the unconscious aspects of the psyche that influence our behavior and emotions. 
8. **Eros/Thanatos**: These forces represent the duality of human nature, which includes both a desire for life and a fascination with death. By balancing these opposing forces, individuals can find harmony within themselves and their relationships.
9. **Grief**: The Heart Chakra is closely linked to grief and loss. This includes learning to let go of negative emotions and finding solace in the present moment.
10. **Compassion**: The Fourth Chakra promotes compassion as a means of connecting with others on a deeper level. By cultivating empathy and understanding, individuals can develop a sense of interconnectedness with all living beings.
11. **Devotion**: The Heart Chakra encourages individuals to find meaning and purpose in their lives through devotion. This may involve dedicating oneself to a spiritual practice, a cause, or even a relationship. 

#### THE MYSTERY OF LOVE

Through balance we find a center from which we can love, through love we form relationships, and through relationships we have the opportunity to transform the self-centered ego of the lower chakras into awareness of the larger realm in which we are embedded.

When we fall in love, we are suddenly stripped of our defenses, lifted out of our self-centered habits, and propelled into an enlarged view of the world. Love melts our rigid attitudes and alters our psychic structure.

Intimacy is the foundation for that expression Being loved by another increases our experience of Self, as we are reflected in the eyes, words, and behavior of our lover.

Ancient tantric diagrams depict the heart chakra as a lotus of twelve petals containing a six-pointed star made of two interlacing triangles. This represents the downward movement of spirit into matter and the upward liberation of matter into spirit, meeting in perfect balance in the heart. 

More than just a meeting, this is an interpenetration whose final goal is integration of spirit and mind with body and soul.

Balance is the underlying foundation of longevity in all things. Since the heart chakra is the middle point in a system of seven centers, balance is an essential principle at this level of integration. 

To have intimacy we first need to have a sense of self. We need to be intimate with our own interior, to know our needs, wishes, fears, boundaries, and hopes. Through knowing the self within, we can honor the self that lives within another.

We need to be able to love our own self enough to offer it openly to someone else. The most common block in the heart chakra is the absence of self-love. How can we have intimacy with others if we are distanced from our own self

#### SELF-REFLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS

1. The ability to observe oneself, including motives, actions, goals, hopes, and fears.
2. *Self-examination* - A process that allows us to integrate our psychic pieces and create new patterns for growth and evolution.
3. *Conscious attention* - The focus required to change patterns and create something new.
4. *Balance* - The central principle of the heart chakra, achieved through self-examination.
5. *Self-examination gives birth to a new integrated Self* - Through self-reflection, we can break free from past patterns and move towards personal growth.

#### MIND AND BODY

* Balance in the heart chakra involves learning to decipher the body's messages through inner listening.
* This process leads to recovering memories, working through traumas, releasing stored tensions, and completing unresolved emotional transactions.
* Various parts of our experience are reconnected: feelings with mental images, impulses with belief systems, sensation with meaning.
* Self-reflection allows the mind to behold our experience in the body.
* Integrating awareness from lower chakras into higher levels of complexity and understanding is possible after fully embodying ourselves.

#### ANIMA AND ANIMUS

1. Jungian Theory: Anima is the archetypal energy of the inner feminine, while animus represents the inner masculine. Both genders carry each archetype.
2. Stereotypes: Cultural influences shape our images of masculinity and femininity, leading to polarization and repression of one's anima or animus.
3. Projection: The unconscious anima or animus is often projected onto others, causing issues in relationships.
4. Midlife Crisis: At midlife, individuals may experience a crisis that calls forth their repressed archetype, leading to personal growth and development.

#### RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS

* Love unites living beings by completing and fulfilling them through what is deepest within themselves.
* Balance is crucial for the success of personal relationships.
* Imbalance leads to pressure, frustration, stress, resentment, and erosion of openness and goodwill.
* Relationships must find an equitable balance to avoid failure.
* Balance is a dynamic flexibility that fluctuates over time in various ways.

#### REACHING OUT AND TAKING IN

1. Fear and grief can block either or both of these responses, leading to heart chakra blockage.
3. Reaching may become blocked if it proved fruitless in the past, leading to an energetic structure built around emptiness.
4. One movement (reaching or taking in) is often more prevalent than the other in a relationship.
5. The pursuer-distancer dynamic can be resolved when the pursuer stops chasing and the distancer reaches out.
6. To avoid abandoning oneself and ensure mutual reaching, it is essential to practice pulling one's lover in while holding one's own ground.

#### ATTACHMENT AND FREEDOM

The heart chakra seeks to balance the lower chakras' pull for security with the upper chakras' attraction toward novelty. 

A healthy relationship must honor both upward and downward energy movements, creating a balance between spirit and soul, expansion and constriction, freedom and commitment. 

To decide on one or the other is to further the divide between transcendence and immanence.

The more one kind of energy is allowed, the more the opposite can come through. 

Once a commitment is made, it becomes easier to allow a partner their solitude or freedom; once we know our freedom is respected, we can more easily make a commitment. 

Dynamic balance is a dance between attachment and freedom.

#### EROS AND THANATOS

**Eros** - The force of life that allures and unites; son of Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty.
**Thanatos** - The force of death that divides and destroys; born of the goddess Night, thrives on darkness of our lack of consciousness.

When entering a relationship, we are swept up by Eros's wings, beckoned into union, merging, and dissolving.

To love means to open ourselves to both positive and negative aspects - joy, fulfillment, grief, sorrow, disappointment.

Our unconscious patterns sabotage relationships, pick fights, distance ourselves from our lover, and thrust behavior in directions the conscious mind deplores.

Thanatos is a force we cannot control; it leaves us feeling helpless.

Eros and Thanatos are inseparable forces in a single dance; one cannot exist without the other.

Idealistic lovers may face great pain when their partner mistreats what they considered sacred.

Denial of Thanatos invites its more unpleasant form to appear; we must be aware of our shadow and need for separateness.

#### GRIEF: DEMON OF THE HEART

1. Grief is a natural response to loss and can be seen as a demon that sits on the heart chakra.
2. When grief is denied or suppressed, it can lead to numbness and a lack of aliveness.
3. Acknowledging and expressing grief can help open the heart, allowing for deeper connections with others.
4. Grief can also occur in situations where love is not reciprocated or when one feels abandoned.
5. Codependency can result from unhealthy relationships, such as those characterized by smothering and possessiveness.
6. Grief can be a mourning for the loss of authenticity and can lead to depression if not addressed.
7. Compassion is an important healer in addressing grief and promoting well-being and spiritual growth.

#### COMPASSION

* Compassion means "to have passion with" and involves understanding another's needs beyond one's own.
* The ability to have compassion for others depends on being in touch with one's yearnings and pain, which opens us up to deeper understanding of others and expands our limited being.
* Compassion is an exquisite balance of upper and lower chakra expression, remaining centered yet open while holding the space for change to occur.
* Chenrezig, a Buddhist deity, represents compassion and does not mean fixing things but rather offering empathy and understanding when solutions are not possible.

#### DEVOTION

* Devotion is an act of selfless love and conscious surrender to a greater force beyond oneself.
* In yoga, it's the path of bhakti yoga, practiced through devotional service to a deity or teacher.
* Devotion can also be experienced toward loved ones, political causes, or projects.
* It allows the energy within the Self to flow beyond the Self, transcending perceived limitations.
* When we become parents, we experience selfless devotion to our child.
* Devotion is a spiritual act of egoless surrender; it expands the binding of the spirit by lifting us beyond ourselves.
* The Self survives even without constant attention.
* Devotion can keep us from conscious connection with the Self if ego-based reflective consciousness hasn't been achieved.

### GROWING THE LOTUS

The developmental formation of the heart chakra in children aged 4 to 7 years primarily focuses on the growth of social identity, gender roles, altruism, and peer relationships. 

One of the key tasks during this period is the formation of social identity and gender roles. Children start to understand that they belong to a particular group or community and that they have specific roles within it. 

They also begin to identify with certain gender norms and expectations, which can influence their behavior and interactions with others.

Another important task is the development of altruism. At this age, children become more aware of the needs and feelings of others and start to show empathy and compassion towards them. This can be seen in their willingness to share toys or help a friend who is upset.

Formation of peer relationships is another crucial aspect of the heart chakra development during this period. Children begin to form friendships with other children, which helps them develop social skills and learn how to interact with others. 

However, along with these positive developments, there are also some challenges that children may face during this stage. One such challenge is the balance between initiative and guilt. Children may feel guilty for taking the lead or making decisions, which can hinder their ability to assert themselves and take responsibility for their actions.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

Lack of love is devastating as it disintegrates us from ourselves. Love integrates and lack of love disintegrates. Children are confronted by a tormenter they love, not one they hate, which has a tragic influence on their entire life.

**Abuse Traumatizes the Heart Chakra**: Most abuses occur within family relationships and happen at the hands of people we love. This distorts our relationship and causes us to shut down the connection, close off the heart, and pull back into ourselves.

**Relational Capacity**: When primary relationships are distorted, our ability to love and connect is diminished. We see the bigger picture less clearly, preventing us from rising into a larger sense of our own being.

**Childhood Abuse Effects**: A child's trust and love for caretakers can be used against them, causing simultaneous effects on three levels: 1) The experience of abuse, 2) Interpretation of the abuse, and 3) Fusion of abuse with love. This link perpetuates abuse in adult relationships.

**Superficial Love**: If a child is not touched or given specific attention, their love for others will be superficial. They suffer physically from lack of touch, emotionally from feelings of shame, and conceptually from a distorted concept of love.

**Sexual Abuse**: A father sexually abusing his daughter who loves and trusts him teaches her a distorted form of relating with no respect for boundaries. Adult survivors often feel disembodied, have poor boundaries in their relationships, and define their worth in sexual terms.

**Internalized Criticism**: If a child is ignored or shamed by important people in their life, they internalize that distortion in their relationship to themselves. Their own internal voice carries that criticism, keeping them in a state of utter worthlessness.

#### THE ABUSE ITSELF 

1. Abuse teaches a form of love that undermines natural developmental processes and interferes with the internal wiring of the physical, emotional, and psychic system.
2. Abuse makes individuals feel unlovable, defective, and ashamed, leading to a loss of self-love and connection to their divinity.
3. Without relationship to the self, reflective consciousness is impossible, leaving individuals disconnected from their ground and seeking it through others.
4. When individuals give everything to someone else, they become bankrupt and lack a center to attract others because no one is home within them.

#### INTERNALIZED RELATIONSHIPS

Our relationship with our mother affects how we understand the archetypal symbol of Mother as well as the feminine in general. If mistreated, our internal relationship to the feminine will be impaired.

We project this impairment on women we meet in life, relating more to our damaged internal image of the feminine than to actual women.

Our father's treatment affects our relationship with all men as well as our internal masculine qualities, such as aggression, authority, logic, or initiative.

The heart chakra is about bonding. Unintegrated parts of ourselves seek bonding elsewhere, leading to unhealthy relationships with partners who carry critical parents, needy children, or rejecting aspects of their personality.

To break these patterns, we must become conscious of our internal relationships within ourselves by listening, discovering, and honoring the many aspects of our inner complexity.

#### TWISTED CONCEPTS OF LOVE

1. *Conflicted relationships skew our conception of love.*
2. *Children equate love with pain and mistreatment.*
3. *Acceptance of abuse impacts the heart chakra, as well as the upper three chakras.*
4. *The love a child has for his or her parents ensures that their conscious or unconscious acts of mental cruelty will go undetected.*
5. *In adult relationships, we may be blind to abuse from our partner due to the fantasy bond illusion.*

#### REJECTION

1. Rejection is a universal experience that wounds all humans deeply.
2. Fear of rejection causes people to hold back their love and close down their heart chakra.
3. When rejection occurs, we feel helpless, our self-esteem plummets, and we may experience unfathomable depression and longing.
4. Rejection magnifies basic shame and turns us against ourselves, creating the deepest wound of all.
5. For young children, rejection is equivalent to death as they rely on their parents for survival.
6. When we deeply love someone, we identify with them and share their feelings, so when rejected, we adopt the same stance and reject ourselves.
7. Some people get angry instead of sad after being rejected, which can be a means of self-preservation.
8. Rejection can uncover truths that need to be faced, but too much anger may obscure these lessons.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE RIGID \ Hysteric

1. **The Rigid (Achiever)**
  a. Henry was a highly successful CEO with a good-looking and personable appearance.
  b. Henry's heart was blocked due to parental rejection during his fourth chakra developmental period.
  c. His father had high expectations for him, leading to feelings of inadequacy.
  d. He channeled his aggressive energy into achievement, hoping it would win love and recognition.
  e. Despite being successful, he was unable to experience satisfaction or healing due to the rejection of his true self.

2. **The Hysteric**
  a. Women tend toward this character structure more often than men due to cultural permission for emotional expression.
  b. The original wound is similar to the Rigid type, with rejection from the father and high expectations for performance.
  c. She focuses on family and relationships, seeking closeness but becoming demanding and possessive.
  d. She identifies with her social and emotional identities, creating excess in chakra two.
  e. On the positive side, she can be caring and supportive when her needs are met.

#### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY EXCESS

Excess in the heart chakra occurs when one overcompensates for their own wounds by using love excessively, which leads to others becoming victims in their drama of overcompensating. 

Deficiency in the heart chakra occurs when one withdraws from love due to past wounds, leading to a closed system where love becomes conditional. The deficient heart chakra responds to wounds of love by waiting for someone to make the first move and fix their pain. 

A combination of both excess and deficiency in the heart chakra can lead to oscillating between openness and closedness, depending on the individual's emotional state. It is important to examine one's basic stance in life and bring it into balance whenever possible.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS HEALING THE HEART CHAKRA

1. Love is the essence that heals.
2. Patience, skill, training, and talent all play their part, but without love they are merely techniques.
3. All wounds cry for the universal medicine of love.
4. The cosmic glue of the universe, love is the force that bridges the gaps that cut us asunder.
5. Soulful love, as Thomas Moore has so aptly stated, is neither abstract nor empty, but worships the particular, the unique, the individuated self.
6. Honoring our individuality, we honor the subtle relationships within ourselves.
7. Our feelings are brought into relationship with our belief systems; our vulnerable child forms an alliance with our responsible adult; our inner masculine makes love with the inner feminine.
8. As we reflect upon ourselves, we integrate more and more pieces of ourselves.
9. Our sense of the whole becomes larger and stronger like an ecosystem whose stability and magnificence increases with diversity.
10. We become more complex, more mature, and capable of greater and greater possibilities.
11. This sets the ground for creativity in chakra five, and for penetrating insight and understanding in chakras six and seven.
12. Reflective consciousness allows this integration and it is the task usually undertaken through psychotherapy.
13. Our capacity for understanding and working with outer relationships is enhanced by the sophistication of our inner one.
14. Instead of relating from a single part of ourselves, which makes us inflexible, we have a broader base from which to relate.
15. There is simply more there for another to be attracted to, and more of us there to meet them.
16. Self-acceptance sets the stage for our social identity.
17. We can then see our role within the complex web of relationships around us, and can bring balance to the larger components of our culture.

#### LOVE OPENS WITH FEELING

* Love opens with feeling: Feelings are the antennae of the soul.
* When our feelings are hurt, we react protectively and close down our feelings.
* The realm of feelings is an internal flow of energy that moves through the body.
* In the heart chakra, we access feelings by use of the breath.
* Holding back feelings restricts vital nourishment to cells and muscles.
* Deepening the breath allows repressed feelings to surface and be mobilized.
* The first step in breath work is to feel your own breathing and have someone else watch you breathe.
* Notice how you hold your breath, whether you hold it before exhaling or taking the next breath.
* Notice what feelings, impulses, and desires arise during this process.

#### REACHING OUT AND TAKING IN WITH THE BREATH

*Exercise for opening the heart*: Coordinate reaching out and taking in movement with breath exhale and inhale.
1. Have friend lay down, notice breathing rhythms, gently encourage awareness of held parts, lightly massage shoulders/pectoral muscles/heart chakra area.
2. Encourage partner to reach arms forward on exhale, pull them in toward heart chakra on inhale; slow and conscious motions.
3. Think of things that make you feel loved, let go of fear of rejection, offer love from your own heart.
3. Stand over partner, grab hands, offer resistance when pulling arms in/pushing away to increase energy flow and open blocked feelings; observe and provide feedback.

#### GRIEF WORK

1. Grief work is essential for reclaiming lost parts of oneself after experiencing loss, especially when it comes to loved ones.
2. The point of grief work is to regain connection with the self inside rather than increase attachment to what was lost.
3. Forgiveness is an important step in healing and involves understanding situations in terms of the forces acting on both ourselves and others.
4. To forgive oneself, one must look at their actions compassionately, separate their basic essence from the mistake made, and make amends if necessary.
5. Forgiving others for harm they have caused is often more difficult but can be encouraged through understanding the forces acting on them at the time.

#### LOVE MUST BE WILLED AND CREATED, AS WELL AS FELT

- The feeling of love may not be present, but it can still be created through action.
- Love is a daily commitment to behave in a loving and caring fashion towards oneself and others.
- The purpose of the fourth chakra is to expand beyond one's limited ego into a wider sense of connection with all life.
- It is important not to deny or neglect the smaller self, but to find joy in service and altruism.

Love Must Maintain a Balance of Energies:
- The heart chakra should not be wide open in our crowded social milieu; it needs boundaries to feel protected.
- Many people struggle with balancing intimacy and autonomy, favoring one side over the other.

#### COME CLOSER, GO AWAY

Sit in front of your partner cross-legged or in a chair, with hands meeting at heart level. Allow your partner to pull your hands towards their heart while saying "Come closer." Offer some resistance but not enough to block the movement. When hands reach the heart, allow your partner to push them back away from their body, saying "Go away." Repeat this process, allowing feelings and resistances to arise.

The exercise can reveal whether one or both partners want more closeness or distance, and how balanced the relationship is.

* Healing the heart involves attending to vulnerable and sacred aspects within ourselves.
* Manipulation, derision, criticisms, or command will not work in healing the heart; love is needed instead.
* Through love, we can expose our instinctual core and evolve to expressing our truth.
* Relationships further the evolution of individual souls and the collective soul of our planet.

## CHAKRA FIVE

* Chakra Five, also known as Vissudha or the Throat Chakra, focuses on communication, creativity, and self-expression.
* It is associated with the element of sound and located at the throat and pharyngeal plexus.
* The color of this chakra is bright blue.
* Key issues include communication, creativity, listening, resonance, and finding one's own voice.
* Balanced characteristics include a resonant voice, good listening skills, good sense of timing and rhythm, clear communication, and living creatively.
* Traumas and abuses associated with this chakra include lies, mixed messages, verbal abuse, excessive criticism, secrets, authoritarian parents, alcoholic or chemical-dependent families, and a lack of trust or feeling.
* Deficiencies in the Throat Chakra can lead to fear of speaking, a small or weak voice, difficulty putting feelings into words, introversion, shyness, tone deafness, and poor rhythm.
* Excessive talking, talking as a defense, inability to listen, poor auditory comprehension, gossiping, a dominating voice, interruptions, disorders of the throat, ears, voice, neck, tightness of the jaw, and toxicity are also associated with this chakra.
* Healing practices include loosening the neck and shoulders, releasing one's voice through singing, chanting, toning, storytelling, journal writing, automatic writing, practicing silence (excess), non-goal-oriented creativity, psychotherapy, learning communication skills, completing communications, letter writing, inner child communication, and voice dialog.
* Affirmations for the Throat Chakra include "I hear and speak the truth," "I express myself with clear intent," "Creativity flows in and through me," and "My voice is necessary."

### SHADES OF BLUE

* Our modern world bombards us with dissonance—vibrations that we tune out of our conscious mind while our body and nervous system continue to endure. The result is a series of little stresses that can add up to larger stress with the potential to break down our entire system.

* Anyone who lives in a modern urban environment is assaulted by sound on a constant basis. Only recently in the span of human evolution are we as polluted by unwelcome sound as we are today. Two hundred years ago, in the city of Vienna, fire alarms could be given verbally by someone shouting from the top of a cathedral. 

* Unable to close our ears, this is a pollution against which we have very little defense. OSHA estimates that more than half of American production workers are exposed to an ongoing noise level of 80 dBA or higher, while the maximum intensity one can withstand over time without hearing loss is 75 dBA.

### UNFOLDING THE PETALS

The fifth chakra, also known as the throat chakra, which is associated with various aspects of human experience such as symbolic thinking, resonance, etheric body, communication, voice, truth and lies, and creativity.

The fifth chakra is located at the base of the throat and is responsible for our ability to communicate effectively, both verbally and non-verbally. 

It is also associated with symbolic thinking, which involves interpreting symbols and their meanings. Resonance, another aspect of the fifth chakra, refers to the vibrational energy that connects us to others and the universe as a whole.

The etheric body, which is closely linked to the fifth chakra, is an invisible energy field that surrounds our physical body and plays a crucial role in our overall health and well-being. The voice, another aspect of the fifth chakra, is not only a means of communication but also a powerful tool for self-expression and healing.

#### THE SUBTLE WORLD OF VIBRATIONS

1. Sound is the paradigm of creation and its dissolution is reabsorption into its source.
2. Entering the etheric level of the throat chakra involves a paradoxical realm of great subtlety yet powerful influence.
3. We leave behind the balanced middle ground of the green ray and reach into the etheric range of turquoise and blue that resonate with the throat chakra.
4. The enveloping element of air still surrounds us, but we reach beyond it into the unknown ether—the realm of vibrations, sound, communication, and creativity.
5. We have passed the halfway point in our rainbow journey, focusing more heavily on the upper chakras.
6. In the dance between liberation and manifestation, we are now leaving the balance of the heart to focus more on the upper chakras.
7. We are breaking free from gravity, free from the way things have always been and from the structure and restriction of manifested form.
9. In chakra five, our attention moves to vibrations as the subtle, rhythmic pulsations that move through all things.

#### ENTERING THE SYMBOLIC

* Symbols originate from the deepest parts of the soul, while language only skims the surface of understanding.
* Words, images, and thoughts (chakras five, six, and seven) represent the symbolic world of the mind.
* Each word is a symbol for something real, each image in our mind is a mental symbol, and each thought is a combination of these symbols.
* Symbols allow us to communicate more effectively with less effort; we can talk about things we cannot physically experience or describe.
* Symbols are the building blocks of communication and consciousness, like packets of meaning that can be shared between minds.
* When a symbol resonates with someone, it means they deeply connect with its essence.

#### RESONANCE

- *Resonance is a state of __synchronization__ among vibrational patterns.*
- *All vibrations can be thought of as __wavelike movements__ through space and time.*
- *Each waveform has a characteristic __rhythm__ (known as frequency) that describes how frequently the waves rise and fall.*
- *When two or more sounds from __different sources vibrate at the same frequency__, they are said to resonate together.*
- *The rhythmic entrainment of various frequencies within our body and consciousness forms __a coherent, central vibration__ that we experience as a kind of resonant “hum” on good days.*
- *Resonance requires a certain __balance of flexibility__ and tension.*
- *In our bodies, we need to have enough flexibility to resonate with different frequencies, yet maintain enough tension to create a repeating pattern.*

When we can’t resonate with the world around us, we can't link with it. We are unable to expand, respond, or receive.

Opening to resonance requires both grounding for the establishment of form, and an openness of breath that yields softness and flexibility.

#### THE ETHERIC BODY

1. The etheric body is a subtler field generated by internal processes, including energy exchange, digestion, neuron firing, and emotional state.
2. A resonant etheric field makes coherent connections with the outside world, while a fragmented field creates fragmented connections.
3. Kirlian photography has revealed that the etheric body is more responsive to subtle vibrations of thoughts than major alterations in the physical body.
4. The fifth chakra, vissudha, represents purification and refinement of vibrations through ridding the body of toxins, speaking truthfully, and working through lower chakras' issues.

#### COMMUNICATION

* Communication is the essential function of the fifth chakra.
* The throat chakra is the internal gateway between mind and body.
* A healthy fifth chakra results in a resonant, rhythmic, truthful, clear, and concise voice.
* Contraction in the body restricts the voice, while lack of feeling makes it mechanical.
* Inner dialog between different voices helps with integration.
* Integration creates resonance, and the process of individuation honors and integrates each voice.
* Freedom to express ourselves is essential for full individuation.

#### TRUTH AND LIES

- *To fully express individuality is to express one's truth.*
- *A person without ego strength will be afraid of what others think and give up their authenticity.*
- *If your lower chakras are in good order, you can safely express your own personal truth.*
- *To live in truth is to be able to live in contradictions—to accept that each piece can be true without negating the other.*
- *Negative experiences teach us to deny and withhold our truth, leading to a restriction of the natural resonance of the etheric field.*
- *When we are out of our truth, we are living a lie, which forms the demon of the fifth chakra.*

#### CREATIVITY

- *Communication is a creative expression of all that is within us.
- *Situated between the third and seventh chakras, creativity combines will and consciousness to move us forward into the future.
- *Creativity in the fifth chakra is consciously willed, shaping our reality through actions, expression, and communication.
- *Creativity is a pure expression of the spirit within us, allowing the Self to give back to the world an assimilated form of what it has taken in.

### GROWING THE LOTUS

Age 7-12 is the developmental formation stage for the fifth chakra.

Tasks include self-expression, symbolic reasoning, and communication skills.

Needs and issues include industry vs. inferiority, creativity, access to tools for learning and creativity, and exposure to a larger world.

Vibrations, pulsations, and streamings are essential for human relationships, freedom, and social concern.

Allowing a child's own streamings to develop and intensify leads to individuality and connectedness.

1. Developmental stages are less clearly defined in higher chakras, especially in the development of communication.
2. We begin receiving vibrational and chemical communication from our mothers in the womb.
3. As infants, we are immersed in a field of language and react to noises, voice tone, and facial expression.
4. At nine months, we realize that sounds represent real things and begin imitating sounds around us.
5. By twelve months, we can speak a few words, respond to simple words like "no," or recognize our name.
6. By two years, we can express ourselves in simple sentences with a vocabulary of about 300 words.
7. By four or five years, there is an explosion of language and the child talks constantly to anybody who will listen!
8. At six years old, a child has a general command of her language, understanding words that represent abstract concepts and phrases describing relationships between things.
9. A seven-year-old can now look backward or forward in time, a process Piaget called reversibility.
10. This stage marks the point where the intellect is able to separate itself from immediate experience long enough to consider alternate realities.
11. Only with this realization is conscious creativity really possible and lies the seed of conscience.
12. In the fourth chakra stage, a child wants to be helpful because helpfulness seems like a positive trait.
13. During the fifth chakra stage, moral behavior has social as well as personal consequences.
15. It is between the ages of seven and twelve (Piaget's period of concrete operations) that the fifth chakra flowers.
16. This stage is marked by more sophisticated symbolic reasoning—the ability to create a mental representation of a series of actions.
17. If the child feels secure in her relationships, then she is more likely to feel secure enough to speak her truth and experiment creatively.
18. The system is maturing—physical growth slows down considerably and basic motor development is in place.
19. The enormous input of energy that the child has required and hopefully received prior to this now begins to move outward through creative expression.
20. With the building blocks of language and relationship in place, mental capacity now expands exponentially.
21. We learn to use symbols to reach beyond our immediate experience.
22. Through school, books, television, conversations, and experience, the child hungrily absorbs information about the world.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

Throat Chakra Blockage: A block in the throat chakra restricts energy flow, causing input to exceed output, leading to stress.

Shame, Fear, and Self-Protection: Shame, fear for safety, or being out of touch with the core self can cause us to close down our throats and bottle up emotions.

Methods of Hiding: We hide by tightening neck and shoulders, throwing head out of alignment, talking incessantly about anything except what's bothering us, stuffing food down our throats, or posting a censor at the door.

Consequences of Hiding: Hiding leads to isolation, lack of intimacy, and stagnation, making it harder to open up and express ourselves.

#### FEAR
The author discusses how fear can lead to a biological instinct to remain quiet, as well as the freezing response that immobilizes the body and causes one to hold their breath. 

The author also highlights how chronic fear can cause the throat chakra to close down, making it difficult for individuals to communicate effectively.

The author also addresses the impact of abuse, excessive criticism, or humiliation during childhood on one's ability to communicate openly. They argue that these experiences can instill a sense of fear in individuals, leading them to live in a state of self-imposed imprisonment and silence.

#### GUILT AND SHAME

1. Guilt and shame make us want to hide ourselves due to perceived flaws within.
2. The outward expression of communication is blocked by guilt and shame, leading to internal voices that act as vicious guardians.
3. Shame rises up as the incessant critic, telling us why no one wants to hear what we are going to say, how we don't know what we're talking about, or how stupid we look.
4. The critic was originally created to protect against real humiliation but becomes overzealous and unrealistic in its criticism.
5. Critics' words become self-fulfilling prophecies, creating fear and awkwardness when expressing oneself.
6. Getting a second opinion from someone else can help challenge the critic and allow for more self-expression.
7. The voice of the child that never talked back to the original critical parent can emerge when allowed, providing liberation.

#### SECRETS

1. *When we keep a secret, we must monitor our body language, eyes, facial expressions, and speech to avoid revealing it.*
2. *Keeping secrets separates us from our true selves and the spontaneous expression of our fifth chakra.*
3. *Secrets can be kept from children regarding their parents' deaths or other family problems, making it difficult for them to ask questions and discuss problems later in life.*
4. *Sexuality is often a taboo subject, leading to shame and guilt around natural sexual feelings and behaviors.*
5. *Keeping secrets promotes ignorance and blocks the flow of energy through the fifth chakra, perpetuating negative behavior patterns.*

#### LIES AND MIXED MESSAGES

* Lies form the demon of the fifth chakra, which is associated with communication and self-expression.
* Being told we have no right to feel a certain way or hearing "I love you" while experiencing abuse, neglect, or shame are examples of lies that scramble our programming in the fifth chakra.
* These lies teach us to lie to ourselves, others, and our bodies, creating dissonance within our basic vibration of self.
* The experience of one's own truth allows for a return to feelings at an adult level without paradise but with the ability to mourn.

#### YELLING AND SCREAMING

1. Children learn by imitation and are influenced by their surroundings.
2. An atmosphere of hostility, such as constant arguing, yelling, or screaming, can negatively impact a child's development.
3. When the home environment is unpleasant to see or hear, children may close down their aural and visual functions.
4. Counter-dialogues often occur in the mind when someone is trying to block out negative stimuli.
5. Authoritarianism, where rules cannot be questioned, limits communication skills and leaves no room for discussion.
6. A child's inner voice must be nurtured in an environment of compassionate exploration to develop properly.

#### NEGLECT

* Neglect can lead to poor communication skills and secrets kept from loved ones.
* Children need conversations with caring adults to develop communication skills, reason, trust, and share.
* Communication helps children gain new information, learn, and grow.
* Learning to communicate is like learning to use a hammer; it's an invaluable tool for building lives and feeling connected, capable, and confident.
* Giving children the gift of clear communication can help them overcome future impasses and difficulties.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE Challenger-Defender

1. Challenger-Defender is characterized by vulnerability, loneliness, and a strong focus on power and communication.
It typically develops between the ages of two and a half to four years (later third chakra) due to deprivation experienced during this time.
3. Challenger-Defenders are highly creative, brilliant communicators, and enjoy positions of power. They often have strong fifth chakras, which can make them charismatic and influential. However, they also tend to be vulnerable and insecure underneath their powerful personas.
4. Challenger-Defenders may struggle with intimacy due to their fear of vulnerability and the need to maintain power. They often choose relationships where they are least likely to be challenged or questioned.
5. Seduction and Manipulation - As children, Challenger-Defenders were often seduced and manipulated by a parent figure, leading them to develop a survival strategy based on deception and ignoring accepted ethics. This can result in a lack of trust and certainty in their relationships as adults.
6. Authority and Trust Issues - Parents of Challenger-Defenders may have been inconsistent with authority, leading to a weak first chakra and openness but danger in the emotional center of the second chakra. This can contribute to their fear of vulnerability and need for power.
7. Need for Love and Security - Despite their powerful personas, Challenger-Defenders still have needs for love, safety, and security. They may struggle to find loved ones who accept their imperfections and do not leave them when they attack.
8. Empowerment through Relationships - In healthy relationships, Challenger-Defenders can gain a sense of true empowerment by being able to tell the truth without judgment. This can help them balance their upper chakra displacement and move toward psychological health.

#### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY

* The throat chakra is a gateway between inner and outer worlds, and its health can be determined by listening to someone's voice. Fast talkers discharge energy through their throat chakras, while quiet individuals are locked inside without enough energy to break free.

* A person with a deficient fifth chakra cannot get his words together; their voice may be weak, airy, pinched, or rhythmically erratic. They experience extreme self-consciousness and shyness, a need to hide, and a fear of humiliation.

* Excess in the Throat Chakra: An excessive fifth chakra uses talking as a defense mechanism to stay in control and discharge energy. This can lead to rapid talking with little real content or displaced rage.

* Combinations of Excess and Deficiency in the Throat Chakra: Lack of ground can produce either excess or deficiency within the throat chakra, leading to varying communication skills.

* Balance in the Throat Chakra: A balanced fifth chakra allows for accurate communication, effective listening, resonant and pleasant voices, and a sense of timing and grace in activities and body movements.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS HEALING THE FIFTH CHAKRA

1. The ability of a substance to resonate sympathetically is the result of its elasticity.
2. Healing the fifth chakra involves a variety of levels simultaneously, ranging from physical to mental.
3. Our bodies are the resonating chambers of the sounds we make, and it is essential to work through bodily tensions for the throat chakra to be free of constraints.
4. The reclamation of the body is the restoration of our unique vibration.
5. We can feel the streaming of energy pulsating through our bodies after physical exertion or emotional expression, such as after a good run, a good cry, or a powerful sexual experience.

#### EXERCISE

* Sound awareness is important because we cannot close our ears, and our environment has a significant impact on our vibrational field.
* Reducing or eliminating toxic noise and people from your environment can help protect your vibrational field.
* Taking time each day to be perfectly quiet is essential for maintaining a healthy vibrational field.
* Periodic weekends in the country can help retune your vibrational field, similar to resetting a thermostat.

#### DEEP LISTENING

* Deep listening involves inner silence and bonding of heart and mind.
* Listening is essential for communication and self-awareness.
* Inner quiet allows the chatter of the mind to subside, revealing the song of the heart.
* Silence connects upper and lower chakras, uniting mind and body.
* Exercise: Sit in a quiet place and listen to sounds around you, including your own breathing and heartbeat. Let all sounds blend into one general sound, and allow your body to move with this rhythm.

#### TONING

Toning encourages basic vibration within the throat as sound, without forcing specific words, melodies, or sounds. It works with both body and breath to create pure expression devoid of intellectual meaning or aesthetic appeal. When we move physically or emotionally, it's natural to make sound, but we often suppress these sounds due to embarrassment, closing down the throat chakra. 

Notice where the sound originates in your body and try to let it come from your whole body at once. This exercise often releases creativity and makes one feel more present.

#### CHANTING AND USING MANTRAS

1. Mantra is not just a technique for awakening; it is itself a state of being that indicates the presence of divinity.
2. Chanting is a more sophisticated form of toning, which lulls the vibrations of our body and consciousness into resonance by rhythmic repetition of a simple phrase or sound.
3. Mantras are chants uttered silently in the mind; they replace the ceaseless rhythm of busy thoughts, cleansing, simplifying, and ordering the mind.
4. Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a meditation technique where one mentally repeats a certain sound given by a teacher or guru. Research shows that silently chanting mantras creates a meditative state by synchronizing brain waves between various lobes of the brain.
5. Each chakra has a specific mantra sound, and there are seed sounds from ancient tantric texts believed to access elemental qualities of the chakras as well as vowel sounds that resonate in the body itself.
6. Leah Garfield suggests chanting the seed sounds in a specific rhythm nine times each with a full minute of silence between each chakra.
7. To create your own mantra, pick sounds from one to three chakras you want to improve and put them together in a pleasing way. Then sit in silent meditation mentally intoning the sound you have created, imagining the chakras expanding or clearing.

#### COMMUNICATION

Techniques for toning the chakra in general allow sound to come through our bodies more easily.

- *Need to be heard* - To be understood, seek first to understand. Steven R. Covey emphasizes that one of the most profound human needs is the need to be heard.
- *Healing through listening* - When our story, feelings, or opinions are simply heard, we feel complete and ready to move onward. The need to be heard validates our truth, individuality, and existence.
- *Importance of acknowledgment over solutions* - In some cases, the need to be heard is more important than finding solutions, especially in couples' dynamics.

#### ACTIVE LISTENING

1. Quiet self and focus energy on other person.
2. Nod or say "mmhm" to let them know you're with them, but don't interrupt or make comments.
3. When speaker is finished, ask if they are complete.
4. Ask questions or clarify something without making comments, suggestions, arguments, or judgments.
5. Repeat what you heard in your own words to ensure understanding.
6. Avoid parroting exact words; phrase response in a way that communicates your understanding of what was said.
7. Co-communicator has chance to let you know if you heard them correctly.
8. If there is a correction, try again until you understand correctly.
9. Only when the first speaker is satisfied are they ready for the second speaker to share their truth.
10. Both people must be satisfied that they have been fully heard before creating a solution.

#### Writing
1. Use pen or computer keyboard to sit in silence and write down feelings without censoring them.
2. Write about unexpressed and unresolved issues with someone, using any words desired.
3. Read writing aloud to an active listener to experience being heard.
4. Find ways to communicate the salient points without heat of emotion.
5. Practice dialog between you and the person you're communicating with in real life.
6. Writing can also be helpful when communicating with people who are unavailable or unwilling to respond.

#### Music
* Music has a profound effect on our mind-body system, affecting emotions, movement, and consciousness.
* It can be used as a tool for healing, uniting the soul of the body with the mind and spirit.
* Shamanic medicine works in part on the principle of resonance through music and drumming.
* Music travels across auditory nerves to the thalamus in the brain, affecting emotions and involuntary processes.
* The limbic system, surrounding the thalamus, is connected to emotions and the endocrine system, influencing chakras and involuntary processes.

### CONCLUSION

*Harmony* is essential for preventing tragedy in individual and multitude lives.

In Indian philosophy, sound is considered a primordial ingredient of creation.

Sound was given to Brahma and Saraswati, who rule over creation and beginnings.

The fifth chakra facilitates a passage between abstract information and manifested reality.

On the spiritual plane, sound brings us into resonance and harmony, providing information and understanding.

#### Sound is the prime transmitter of consciousness itself.

Although sound is a primordial ingredient of existence, it's consciousness that creates and maintains life.

## CHAKRA SIX
* Chakra Six, also known as the Ajna or Third Eye Chakra, is located at the forehead and brow area, and its color is indigo.
* Its element is light, and its purpose is pattern recognition.
* Issues related to this chakra include image, intuition, imagination, visualization, insight, dreams, and vision.
* Balanced characteristics of a person with a healthy Third Eye Chakra include being intuitive, perceptive, imaginative, having good memory and dream recall, and the ability to think symbolically and visualize.
* Traumas and abuses related to this chakra involve seeing things that don't align with what one is told, invalidation of intuition and psychic occurrences, and being in an ugly or frightening environment (e.g., war zone or violence).
* Deficiencies in the Third Eye Chakra can lead to insensitivity, poor vision, difficulty seeing the future, lack of imagination, and difficulty visualizing.
* Excessive energy in this chakra may result in hallucinations, delusions, obsessions, difficulty concentrating, nightmares, and physical malfunctions such as headaches and vision problems.

* Affirmations related to this chakra are "I see all things in clarity" and "I am open to the wisdom within."

### SHADES OF INDIGO

People often base their self-image on societal standards and expectations, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation when they cannot meet these ideals. The passage also highlights the importance of consciousness in shaping one's perception of reality and the need for individuals to break free from illusions created by images in order to see themselves and others more clearly. 

### UNFOLDING THE PETALS

- **Pattern Recognition**: The Sixth Chakra helps us identify patterns in our lives, relationships, and the world around us.
- **Archetypes**: Universal symbols or themes that appear across different cultures and time periods, which can provide guidance and insight into our lives.
- **Symbols**: The Sixth Chakra helps us understand the meaning behind symbols and use them effectively in our daily lives.
- **Images**: The Sixth Chakra allows us to see beyond the surface level of an image, enabling us to connect with its deeper meaning and symbolism.
- **Dreams**: The Sixth Chakra helps us interpret dreams and use them as a tool for personal growth and transformation.
- **Intuition**: The Sixth Chakra enhances our intuitive abilities, allowing us to make better decisions and navigate life's challenges with greater ease.
- **Transcendence**: The Sixth Chakra helps us achieve this state of transcendence, allowing us to experience a deeper connection with the universe.
- **Vision**: The Sixth Chakra enhances our ability to see beyond the present moment and create a positive future for ourselves.
- **Clairvoyance**: The Sixth Chakra helps us develop this psychic ability, allowing us to tap into our intuitive powers and gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
- **Illusion**: The Sixth Chakra helps us recognize illusions and see through them, enabling us to live more authentically and connect with our true selves.

#### OPENING THE THIRD EYE

1. Psychic development requires attraction of symbol, not just intention and will (Jung).
2. Brow chakra allows new vision, adding indigo to bridge; we can see where we've been, are now, and predict future.
3. Sight gives guidance for actions, transforming impulses into creative acts of will.
4. Element of this chakra is light, a higher vibration than sound in the chakra below.
5. Light enables seeing from distance, perceiving shape and form; inner sight goes beyond physical perception.
6. Third eye (sixth chakra) is organ of inner perception, witnessing internal screen with memory, fantasy, images, archetypes, intuition, imagination.
7. Purpose of sixth chakra is to see the way and bring light of consciousness to all that exists within and around us.

#### PATTERN RECOGNITION The eyes are the gateways to the soul. WILLIAM

*Recognition of patterns allows us to predict future events based on past experiences, which can either shut off the possibility of new information or spare us from unwanted experiences.*
*Once we recognize a pattern, we can intuit what it will become and guide our actions accordingly, leading to insight and wisdom.*
*The third eye is associated with inner sight, allowing us to see beyond our egocentricity and find deeper meaning in all things.*
*As inner sight develops, illusions are shattered, dreams are integrated, clarity begins, and consciousness extends beyond the lower five chakras alone.*

#### ILLUSION

When we fixate on an image, everything becomes food for its embellishment.

If we think someone dislikes us, we take the slightest disharmony as proof.

The more we are attached to an illusion, the more energy we need to invest.

Illusion does not feed back the energy we invest and continues to lure us into its false promises.

When illusion is fed by a sixth chakra excess, it becomes obsession or delusion.

#### ARCHETYPES

1. Archetypes are bits of information that assemble and reveal the identity of the whole.
2. The archetype is a composite of images and experiences constellated by a common theme, like morphogenetic fields that shape our understanding. It lies in the unconscious and influences our life.
3. Archetypes are like strange attractors of chaos theory, which cannot be seen directly but are apparent in the events of our lives. 
4. The Hero archetype represents the quest to achieve something extraordinary, while the Great Mother archetype represents the quest for love and nurturing.
5. Archetypes are embedded in a larger field, carrying a numinous energy that can be felt when we encounter them. They also carry a meaning and purpose that dictates smaller details within.
6. The unconscious is the totality of all archetypes, which are embedded in a larger field and carry a numinous energy. When we encounter an archetype, we may feel a strong psychic charge imbuing everything around us with great significance.
7. Archetypal energies not only give us meaning but also direction. 
8. The archetype becomes an ally rather than an invisible dictator when we recognize it, allowing us to break the cycle of unconscious subroutines in our behavior and belief systems.
9. Archetypes are simultaneously immanent and transcendent. They are immanent when we experience them as something inside that we bring forth from within ourselves, and transcendent in that they resonate with a larger meta-structure.
10. Archetypal energies are found at the core of all mythology and religion, imbued with a powerful energy that resonates deep in our psyches. Over time, archetypes get invested with collective psychic energy, influencing culture.

#### IMAGE AS SYMBOL

* Symbols are a means of manifesting archetypes in the physical world.
* We can never encounter an archetype directly; only its symbol is discernible.
* Language, both verbal and visual, is composed of symbols that represent sounds or images.
* Symbols communicate about deep archetypal energies through a whole-brain approach.
* Archetypes are nonphysical templates for psychic energy, which become integrated into consciousness through symbols.
* Symbols emerge when we recognize patterns and can be found in dreams, fantasies, art, and chance encounters.

#### Dreams
* Dreams link the conscious and unconscious mind, connecting the lower and upper chakras.
* They symbolize the connection between our instincts, feelings, and impulses with larger archetypal energies of spirit.
* Dreams unlock the mystery that unites soul and spirit, individual and universal, into a dynamic and synthesized whole.
* They often present alternative realities and can provide answers to problems that the conscious mind cannot solve.
* Dreams are representations of our inner world as it struggles with external demands.
* The dream is a hidden door into the psyche's primordial night, where we connect with a more universal, truer, and eternal self.
* Dreams maintain homeostasis by compensating for imbalances in our lives.
* They are a primary experience of transcendent consciousness, allowing us to fly, travel through time, or explore the body beyond physical limitations.

#### INTUITION
1. Intuition is a leap towards wholeness from fragmentation.
2. It is an unconscious recognition of pattern and one of the four functions in Jungian typology (sensation, feeling, thinking).
3. Intuition relates to chakra six and is passive, requiring surrender.
4. Living almost entirely in our conscious mind suppresses psychic abilities and makes intuition undeveloped.
5. The rational mind thinks in pieces and is poorly suited for grasping larger wholes on an immediate, experiential level.
6. Intuition is a flash of a match in the darkness that reveals underlying wholeness.
7. Clairvoyance allows us to see auras and chakras, past and future events.
8. It begins with the development of intuition and is a matter of learning to focus internal attention on something long enough to illuminate its patterns.

#### TRANSCENDENT FUNCTION
* The symbol maintains psychic life in a constant flux and carries it onward toward its destined goal by enabling tension and release as an expression of the living movement of the psychic process.
* Chakra structure: 
  - Chakras six and seven correspond to the supra conscious or transcendent, transpersonal, or cosmic consciousness.
  - The lower two chakras are the realm of instincts and unconscious mind, while chakra three is the egoic consciousness.
* Vision: The final outcome of working through chakra six is the emergence of a personal vision, which can address world problems or focus on one's own life. It uses imagination to create something new and shapes our behavior. 

*A vision leads us forward, while an illusion holds us back.*

### GROWING THE LOTUS 
#### DEVELOPMENTAL FORMATION OF THE SIXTH CHAKRA

1. *Lotus Developmental Formation* - The process through which individuals develop their sixth chakra during adolescence.
2. *Independence and Originality* - Key tasks for individuals in this stage, as they strive to establish their own identity separate from their parents or caregivers.
3. *Self-reflection* - An essential need for individuals at this stage, as they seek to understand themselves and their place in the world.
4. *Freedom and Responsibility* - Balancing these two concepts is crucial during adolescence, as individuals learn to make decisions and take responsibility for their actions.
5. *Identity vs. Role Confusion* - A common issue faced by adolescents, as they navigate between their own sense of self and the expectations placed upon them by society or their peers.
6. *Symbolic Understanding* - The ability to interpret and understand the world symbolically is a key aspect of human development, particularly during adolescence when individuals are seeking meaning in their experiences.

#### A child’s imagination is almost constantly engaged.

1. Child's imagination is free from fixed knowledge, allowing exploration of possibilities.
2. Pattern recognition develops throughout life, influencing self-perception and understanding.
3. Sixth chakra awakening involves symbolic and abstract thinking (Piaget's formal operations).
4. Adolescence marks a search for meaningful personal identity, often involving archetypal hero worship.
5. Mental apparatus opens with an explosion of imagination during adolescence.
6. The fourth chakra forms social personality unconsciously, while the sixth chakra reevaluates it consciously.

#### ADULT DEVELOPMENT

* Adult development involves symbolic communication and archetypal identity awakening after midlife crisis or adolescence.
* Previously adopted roles no longer satisfy, leading to dissolution and unknown depths without clarity or certainty.
* Attachment to a previous identity may have denied other important aspects of oneself that now emerge in dreams and fantasies.
* Sixth chakra development is spiritual awakening, characterized by new eyesight, profound insight, perspective change, or vision reception.
* It can happen at any time but often preceded by darkness, prompting exploration of the soul's depths for creating a new reality.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

Visual memory is linked with our somatic experience, so abuses to any of the chakras can affect the opening of the sixth chakra. Repression or dissociation are ways to avoid unpleasant feelings associated with an image or memory.

**Repressed Memories**: Closing down the sixth chakra due to repressed memories can lead to deficiency, while dissociation can cause excessive bombardment of images in the psyche without understanding.

**Illusions and Contradictions**: Children may develop illusions or distrust their intuition due to family secrets or contradictions, which can affect their development of other functions.

#### SHAME

* Shame produces intense self-scrutiny in shame-based people.
* They feel compelled to look and perform perfectly at all times, leading to a paralyzing cycle of self-monitoring.
* The vision is turned inward, making it less available for looking outward.
* When the eyes do look outward, they often search for clues about how they're doing, what's wanted of them, and whether they're safe.
* This self-scrutiny program lodged in the sixth chakra takes up most of its "disk" space, blocking new information.
* Severely shame-based people cannot look others in the eye due to their belief that their self is basically flawed.

#### DEFICIENCY

1. If the sixth chakra becomes deficient, its associated faculties remain undeveloped.
2. There is poor intuitive ability, often with a compensating focus on the rational thought process.
3. The person may seem psychically insensitive or "head-blind."
4. This is the dinner guest who doesn't notice that his hosts are looking at their watches and clearing their throats, hinting that it's time to leave.
5. This is the man who wants a date but cannot ask, and fails to see that the woman next to him is actually flirting.
6. When head-blind, we fail to notice the subtle nuances of mood, often including our own.
7. We might not notice until far too late that we had an intuition that something might not work out.
8. With a deficient sixth chakra, we miss the subtleties of our own process

If memory is poor in general, then the sixth chakra may have been closed down for protection.

People with sixth chakra deficiency have difficulty visualizing or imagining things differently.

They cannot imagine what the living room would look like painted blue, cannot imagine life other than the way it is, and cannot imagine themselves behaving differently.

Difficulty with visualization is also frustrating when trying to follow guided meditations or creative visualizations.

When contents of the unconscious are repressed, it may be difficult to remember one's dreams.

We may think we have no dreams (when, in actuality, everyone dreams each night) or we may be unable to retain our dreams in waking consciousness.

#### EXCESS
1. When the image or memory of an event is disconnected from the rest of experience, the energy that is split off is invested in an image.
2. Numerous dissociated images do not get grounded in experience, and an excessive condition develops in the sixth chakra.
3. These elements may haunt the person in dreams, appear as obsessive fantasies, or become full-blown delusions or hallucinations.
4. Such people appear to be laboring under the burden of too much psychic input.
5. They may have many visions, but their visions are farsighted, blind to the realities close at hand.
6. This is the person who is going to make a fortune with their new project when they can't even pay this month's rent, or the one who is already fantasizing about their wedding with a person they've only dated a few times.
7. I call it "vision blindness," as if the image they see blinds them to everything else.
8. Excess energy in the sixth chakra happens when energy is withdrawn from the lower chakras.
9. Without the grounding that brings limitation and simplicity, a person can get lost in the boundlessness of the upper chakras

#### RESTORING THE LOTUS HEALING THE SIXTH CHAKRA

* Mythic consciousness is necessary for psychic and social integration.
* Sixth chakra work focuses on development rather than healing.
* Development requires overcoming bias and disbelief, then applying focus, practice, and discipline to develop awareness.
* Learning to see involves learning how to look and having the patience to do so.
* Each step in the healing process brings clarity to the larger picture.
* Lack of grounding in earth and body makes it difficult to effectively open upper chakras.
* Task at this level is to stimulate awakening for better integration of Self.

#### DREAMWORK

- Dreams teach us to think symbolically, to see and integrate what is hidden, and to access the archetypal realm that dwells both within and without.
- The first step in working with dreams is to learn to remember them.
- If we cannot pull our dreams into waking consciousness in the morning, then we are not successfully getting across this essential link in the bridge—the link between conscious and unconscious.

#### Suggestions for remembering dreams
1. Make an affirmation as you fall asleep each night that you will remember your dreams; 
2. Before you go to sleep, review your day in reverse, starting with the most recent event and moving back through the day to its beginning; 
3. When you wake, do not move your position before mentally reviewing the dream in your semiconscious state. Only when you have reviewed the dream entirely do you let your body move. If you have already rolled over, return to the position you were sleeping in and the dream may come back; 
4. Keep writing implements by your bed and create the habit of writing down whatever you can remember, even fragments; Once the psyche knows that attention is being paid to dreams, recall usually improves dramatically; 
5. Some say supplements such as vitamin B or melatonin increase dream activity and recall. Use of marijuana and alcohol tends to suppress it.

#### FURTHER SUGGESTIONS

1. Write dreams in present tense, using as much detail as possible.
2. Regard the dream as a composite of one's own psyche, with each element representing an aspect of self.
3. Share dreams with others and create art from them to develop a valuable language for communication.

#### Study Mythology
1. Understand archetypal elements in human consciousness through myths. 
2. Knowledge of myths stimulates imagination, brings context and connectedness to healing process, and opens one up to spiritual realm.  
3. Essential for finding deeper meaning in life and bridging internal and external during seventh chakra step into universal consciousness.

#### Visual Art
1. Non-artists can create art to stimulate visual thinking and tap unconscious. 
2. Drawing chakras: Focus on each chakra's energy, draw abstract forms representing feelings, and analyze the resulting drawing for insights.
3. Collages: Pick a theme, cut out relevant images from magazines, arrange them on paper, and glue down to create art reflecting personal growth.

#### MANDALAS

* **Mandala**: A symbol reflecting wholeness, consisting of geometric designs emanating from a center and colored in any way desired. Can be used for meditation on associated chakras.
* **Visualization**: Process similar to seeing psychically; involves imagining or remembering elements not physically present. Helps develop psychic abilities.
* **Creative visualization**: Technique for manifesting desired outcomes by focusing attention on forming images at will, aligning with natural principles of the universe.
* **Guided visualizations and trance journeys**: Useful tools for exploring archetypal realms, seeking visions, healing, and exploration; can be facilitated by friends or guided by music and myths.

#### DEVELOPING INTUITION

* Intuition is available all the time but whether we listen to it or not depends on our belief in its potential to give us useful information.
* To develop intuition, one must tune in deeply to their feelings, listen to their guts, and enter a state of openness and trust.
* Clairvoyant abilities can be developed by anyone through meditation, visualization, and following intuition.
* In workshops on the sixth chakra, participants begin with a combination of meditation and visualization exercises to read each other's chakras.
* Information can come to us in various ways such as visual, kinesthetic, or aural impressions.

#### VISION QUEST

1. Native American religions have a tradition known as the Vision Quest, which is a ritual of purification and listening for spiritual teaching and guidance.
2. It involves willingness to humble oneself, embrace personal ordeal, and undo connection to civilization that blinds our sight.
3. The quester goes into the wilderness alone with minimum equipment for at least three days without food.
4. During this time, they enter a sacred dimension outside the limitations of time and space, opening fully to spirit.
5. They may encounter their own psychological demons, meet animal spirits, have experiences with wind or powerful dreams.
6. There might be an experience of personal ego death followed by a psychological rebirth filled with vision and understanding.
7. After the solo time is done, they thank the spirit of the place and return to share the vision and wisdom gained.

#### Light Exposure

Insufficient exposure to full-spectrum sunlight can cause symptoms such as depression, chronic fatigue, higher stress hormones, and cholesterol levels.

Light enters the body through the eyes and sends signals directly to the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's autonomic nervous system and endocrine system.

The pineal gland is a light-sensitive organ responsible for melatonin production, regulating sleep cycles and coordinating body functions with the external environment.

Meditation improves focus and concentration, which is important for opening inner sight and requires calm and control of the mind.

### CONCLUSION

***Self*** is an inclusive term encompassing our entire living organism, containing past life experiences and serving as a point of departure for future growth.

Ascending to the sixth chakra opens us up to transcendent realms beyond ordinary awareness, shifting perspective on daily situations and providing profound insight and vision.

Expansion of consciousness through the sixth chakra leads to a world of colors, symbols, dreams, fantasy, archetypes, and images, stimulating creativity and increasing understanding.

Chakra six prepares us for the final passage on the Rainbow Bridge by focusing on archetypes, laying the groundwork for understanding the intricate dance of divinity and consciousness in the next chakra.

## CHAKRA SEVEN

The Sahasrara chakra, also known as the thousandfold chakra, is a spiritual center located in the cerebral cortex. Its primary purpose is to facilitate understanding and transcendence through immanence, belief systems, higher power, divinity, union, and vision. The color associated with this chakra is violet, which symbolizes wisdom and spiritual connection.

The Sahasrara chakra helps individuals assimilate knowledge and develop their understanding of the world around them. However, imbalances in this chakra can lead to various issues such as attachment, learning difficulties, rigid belief systems, spiritual cynicism, and excess in lower chakras like materialism and greed.

To maintain a balanced Sahasrara chakra, individuals should engage in healing practices that reestablish physical, emotional, and spiritual connections. This can include learning and study, spiritual discipline, meditation, psychotherapy, examining belief systems, developing an inner witness, and working with higher power. 

Affirmations such as "Divinity resides within," "I am open to new ideas," and "Information I need comes to me" can also help maintain a balanced Sahasrara chakra.

### SHADES OF VIOLET 

#### THE SEPARATION OF SPIRIT AND MATTER

Science examines the world rationally, avoiding spiritual issues.

Corporations often prioritize economic growth over workers' well-being or environmental concerns.

Spirituality is sometimes considered fringe or antithetical to mundane existence.

Monks and nuns renounce worldly pursuits for enlightenment, while New Age philosophy emphasizes transcending the body.

Eastern philosophies encourage letting go of worldly attachments.

The separation of spirit from life leaves people spiritually homeless.

Denying our basic nature to achieve unity is a contradiction in dualistic thinking.

The seventh chakra is about merging with divine consciousness and realizing one's true nature.

**The crown chakra represents the connection between the individual self and universal creation, which manifests through appropriate action, right relationship, and creative contributions.**

#### CONSCIOUSNESS

1. Consciousness is the final frontier, allowing us to perceive our own existence and reflect on its immensity.
2. The crown chakra represents the mystery of individual consciousness.
3. Enlightenment occurs when we realize that consciousness flows through every quantum of life around us and within ourselves.
4. Consciousness is not just thoughts or perceptions; it also remembers, discriminates, and integrates our experiences.
5. We feel the pull of consciousness on our emotions but must understand who or what feels those emotions.
6. Becoming aware of our own consciousness is a miracle, as we can decipher words, learn vast quantities about any subject, and express ourselves creatively.
7. Mystic sages describe consciousness as a unified field in which all of existence is embedded, and sentient beings have the capacity to tap into it.
8. Opening the crown chakra involves expanding our awareness to embrace a larger portion of the universal field of consciousness through meditation, spiritual practice, mystical experiences, altered states of consciousness, study, and paying attention.

#### DIVING IN THE RIVER OF CONSCIOUSNESS

1. Erich Jantsch's three system levels of human consciousness: rational, mythical, and evolutionary.
2. The river metaphor for life's complexity: the rational system (observation and enactment), the mythical system (experience and identification with the river), and the evolutionary system (becoming one with the divine).
3. The importance of embracing all three levels of consciousness for a complete understanding of life and spirituality.

#### THE WITNESS

1. The witness is the essence of that which is seeking.
2. It sits behind our normal activity, observing without judgment.
3. The witness is above and beyond the body and its experiences, memories, dreams, etc.
4. It may be the soul essence living beyond this lifetime or a divine intelligence larger than the Self.
5. To become aware of the witness is to embrace the essence within the Self.
6. The witness is an indestructible spark of divinity and the core of our being.
7. Embracing the witness allows us to swim in the stream when we are flailing about.
8. It is an eternal guide, an invaluable friend, and deep inner awareness of the Self.

#### BELIEF SYSTEMS

- **Belief Systems**: The Crown Chakra as Operating System
- **Meaning-Making**: Interpreting Instructions and Creating Purpose
- **Conception**: Beginning Point of Manifestation
- **Beliefs Shape Reality**: Influencing Interpretations and Behaviors
- **Reprogramming Work**: Examining Belief Systems

#### UNIVERSAL IDENTITY
1. **Physical Identity**: Identifies with the body and its needs and abilities, as well as the physical world around us.
2. **Emotional Identity**: Feels sensations of the physical body and transforms them into value-oriented meaning. Sparks desire and motivation for self-gratification.
3. **Will Identity**: Develops autonomous, separate self (ego) and is primarily concerned with self-definition.
4. **Social Identity**: Expands ego identity to include relationships with others; reflexive quality of this identity is self-acceptance which is essential to acceptance of others.
5. **Creative Identity**: Awareness of the world beyond ourselves, seeks to make a contribution to its culture and arts.
6. **Archetypal Identity**: Identifies with transpersonal, mythic forces that guide our world and lives; transcends individuality and embraces universal connection.
7. **Universal Identity**: Recognizes a unitary identity with the entire creation; transcends lower identities and realizes this universal identity.

#### ATTACHMENT—DEMON OF THE CROWN CHAKRA
1. Attachment inhibits our ability to expand in the crown chakra.
2. Attachment denies the constantly fluid state of the universal system.
3. In Eastern religions, attachment is seen as the basis of suffering.
4. Pain and not getting what I want and expect teach us about our attachments and ourselves.
5. Letting go of attachment is about how we direct our psychic energy.
6. Attachment says we are certain we know what is best and does not allow humility that opens us to something larger.
7. Attachment fixates our energy outside the Self.

#### Higher Power

- Surrendering to a higher power involves releasing attachments, unworkable belief systems, addictive habits, and the need to control.
- This allows individuals to experience their universal identity.
- Our earliest experience with higher power came from parents as children; if childhood was safe, trusting and surrendering to parental love is comfortable for crown chakra. If not, it's difficult.
- Surrendering to a higher power doesn't require relinquishing lower states but involves releasing that which separates us from creation.
- It means letting go of attachments, trusting the universe, and being lifted into grace.
- The crown chakra is a two-way gate to the beyond, opening outward to the infinite and inward/downward to visions, creation, and eventual manifestation.
- Transcendence is a cleansing bath in the waters of spirit, providing relief from limitations.
- The purpose of moving up through the chakras is constant transcendence, with each new plane encompassing the one below in a larger framework. This experience leads to liberation.

#### Transcendence and Immanence

- **Transcendence** is the path of liberation; **immanence** is the path of manifestation.
- Embracing both allows seeing divine within and without as inseparable unity.
- Light shining in our eyes can be blinding, but focused light on something that needs illumination is a blessing.
- Immanence is the light of divine consciousness shining out from within; it manifests presence of divine within and divinity of Self in wholeness.
- From immanence perspective, deity exists in everything living and nonliving.
- A friend once asked why bother with creation when we can go straight to the source; love of creation and force behind it led to pondering this.
- Ignoring beauty of rivers, lakes, oceans because they are not clouds is not advised.
- Looking only at sun instead of delicate play of light in flowers is also not advised.
- Creation is expression of divine; it can be more profound, refined, detailed than source itself (vast and abstract).
- Difference between soul and spirit: soul is immanence within individual, while spirit seeks transcendence and universality.
- Soul is like gatherer of spirit, forming abstract into composite being.
- Spirit may or may not be individual; it can take on many forms.
- Like consciousness, spirit seems to be field that encompasses all beings and connects them in a unified way.

### GROWING THE LOTUS 
#### DEVELOPMENTAL FORMATION OF THE SEVENTH CHAKRA

1. Intellectual independence and spiritual connection are key tasks in seventh chakra development.
2. Development of worldview, education, ego transcendence, and maturation are also important aspects.
3. Spiritual freedom and intellectual stimulation are essential needs for seventh chakra growth.
4. Seventh chakra development builds our cognitive structure, belief systems, understanding of the world, and ability to question and think for ourselves.
5. Learning is a main activity in this stage, constantly adjusting what we know and upgrading our cognitive matrix.
6. The orientation of learning changes at various stages depending on the individual, with a deeper thirsting for knowledge occurring during adolescence.
7. Healthy seventh chakra development involves seeking knowledge throughout life, while unhealthy development may involve fixation in beliefs and require suffering or frustration to change.
8. The difference between sixth and seventh chakra awakening is the shift beyond ego in the search for meaning.
9. Parents can support seventh chakra development by stimulating intellect, organizing learning opportunities, encouraging questioning, modeling spirituality, and providing a broad range of choices.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

Subtle but profound abuses to the crown chakra occur at any age and in many ways, limiting possibilities for focus and concentration (too open) or expansion (too closed). 

Withholding information and invalidating beliefs can cause psychoneurosis.

* **Withholding Information**: Children sense everything around them intuitively but lack understanding; parents often withhold information or shame their questions. This deprives children of proper mental nourishment, leading to poor education and a closed crown chakra.
* **Spiritual Abuse**: Forcing unrealistic purity, strict practices, and insisting on perfection can close the crown chakra, producing shame and fear in children, making it harder for them to open to spirituality later in life. Structured religion is often age-inappropriate.
* **Lack of Love and Respect**: Spiritual practice should include love and respectful regard for individuality; without these, it can be considered abusive. Children are defenseless against this abuse, living in fear, guilt, and shame. They need a variety of spiritual options to find their own fulfilling spirituality.

### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY DEFICIENCY

The intellect should be a competent servant instead of an incompetent master. If the crown chakra is closed down, the liberating current cannot finish its journey, leading to failure to achieve freedom.

#### Deficient
- **Closed Mindedness**: Jane's mother refused to read a book on her religion, claiming she already knew all about God and was not interested. This shows the opposite of infinite knowledge and possibility.
- **Failure to Learn**: Learning is a process of incorporating change as a result of experience. If the crown chakra is closed down, it may be difficult to understand or retain new information.
- **Belief in Limitations**: People often defend their belief in limitations, even when presented with situations where they have been broken. This can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.
- **Spiritual Skepticism**: Some people are attached to the belief that nothing exists outside of the tangible, material world. When extreme, it reveals a deficient seventh chakra.

#### Excess
- **Need to Be Right**: An extremely bright friend always tried to tell others what they were doing wrong and how to fix it. He was unhappy because few people wanted to be around him.
- **Overintellectualism**: Frank rambled on about his latest insights, thinking he was charming everyone with his brilliant intellect. He failed to notice that no one was listening.
- **Spiritual Addiction**: In some cases, spirituality becomes an addiction for the person with an excessive crown chakra. It can be used as an escape from lower chakras or lead to a high and ego-inflating righteousness.
- **Feeling Overwhelmed**: When there is too much information without proper organization, it can lead to confusion, frustration, or dissociation. This can result in headaches and difficulty thinking straight.
- **Psychosis**: Psychotic disturbances arise from a vast range of causes and are characterized by a break from reality and the grounded aspects of the lower chakras. They manifest as voices, hallucinations, or delusional belief systems.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS HEALING THE SEVENTH CHAKRA

* Restoration of the seventh chakra involves awakening to our spiritual nature.
* Eliminating fear, guilt, shame, grief, lies, illusions, and attachments leads to liberation from habitual thought patterns.
* Healing involves removing ourselves from the demands of the outside world, ridding ourselves of false beliefs, and establishing a personal connection with divine source.
* Meditation is an effective tool for developing stillness and concentration to open this chakra.

#### MEDITATION

Meditation is a technique for energizing, calming, and clarifying the mind. Its purpose is to train the mind to enter subtler states of consciousness and transcend petty concerns, allowing us to access a deeper, grander state of awareness.

Of all the methods for healing and developing the crown chakra, meditation is perhaps the most potent tool available.

If universal consciousness is the system in which we are all embedded, and the mind an organizer of its components, then a technique that brings calm, order, and clarity to that mind also brings order and clarity to everything else as well.

Those who practice meditation on a regular basis usually report an increased level of functioning in many aspects of their life, not just their thinking processes. Increased physical health and well-being, greater productivity in their work, better concentration, increased creativity, and more personal satisfaction are some of the effects that have been reported.

###### There are countless techniques that one can use to obtain a meditative state.
- **Nonspecified, free-flowing movement**: 
  -  regulating and watching one's breath
  -  gazing at an image such as a flame, mandala, or symbol
  -  uttering a mantra, phrase, or affirmation
  -  observing the witness
  -  following one's thoughts
  -  walking silently and mindfully
  -  concentrating on a concept or problem (such as the Zen koan "What is the sound of one hand clapping?")
  -  intent listening to sounds or to music
  -  visualizing moving energy up and/or down your body (running energy)
  -  guided visualizations or trance journeys
  -  simply relaxing and letting oneself be receptive to whatever comes through.
- **Concentrative meditation, as described by Patanjali's Yoga Sutras**: 
  - ydharana (concentration)
  - dhyana (meditation or merging)
  - samadhi (ecstasy).

In concrete terms, this involves focusing awareness on an object, allowing it to merge with the object, and experiencing the state of mind that arises when total absorption occurs and there is no longer a sense of subject and object, but only a sense of being.

#### Meditation can have profound results. 

As our thoughts often keep us engaged in repetitive patterns and limited beliefs, meditation can yield a mental silence that allows us to access a deeper wisdom, a deeper state of consciousness.

As we quiet the mind, we have the option to disengage our habitual responses—anger or judgment, fear or desire—and free ourselves from these patterns. As we disengage, we become lighter, emptier, and more able to access the transcendental states of universal consciousness.

Meditation can bring previously buried unconscious material from the lower chakras into consciousness. Thus meditation also serves the ascending, liberating currents as it refines our vibrations chakra by chakra, yielding deeper understanding and self-knowledge.

Once we allow the constant chatter of the mind to subside, the deeper whisperings underneath emerge, just as dreams do when our conscious mind is asleep. What we have not conquered in the past returns again and again.

We may be bombarded with feelings, sensations, or information we are not equipped to handle, or we might be freed of material that was unconsciously holding us back. 

If our work in the lower chakras has formed a foundation for higher consciousness, we will have the tools and context necessary for handling difficult material.

Meditation can also serve the descending current of manifestation. This is the aspect that Sri Aurobindo called the transforming force. 

#### MINDFULNESS

* Mindfulness means paying attention to subtle flavors and textures of each moment.
* It brings us satisfaction in life by immersing us in the richness of each moment.
* Mindfulness does not forget the past or future but brings them together in the present.
* Mindfulness has many enemies, including dissociation, presumptions, numbness, impatience, fear, and chakra demons.
* When we operate by habit or on presumption, we are not fully engaged in the present.
* Numbness shuts off valuable information and robs us of full experience.
* If we are impatient or afraid, we cannot fully engage with the present.
* Mindfulness brings an immensity of information and avoids suffering by living intelligently.
* It is a state of observation that does not judge, value, negate, or applaud; it simply witnesses.

#### EXERCISE TO DISCOVER THE WITNESS

1. Choose a scene, story, or situation that has an emotional charge for you.
2. Observe your reactions to the drama using meditation techniques.
3. Pause and observe your reaction when a part affects you strongly.
4. Write down your observations as if describing a third person.
5. Meet the witness by writing in first person about their observations.
6. Remember that the witness is not the judge, and turn the witness on the critic.
7. Witness your witnesses in multiple layers until you find an objective core Self.
8. This core Self has much wisdom, which we know when we find it.

#### WITH ANOTHER:
1. Pick a scene, story, or situation that troubles you.
2. Tell the story to a friend or therapist in first person, sharing your feelings and thoughts.
3. Retell the story from the perspective of an objective witness.
4. The listener acknowledges but does not interrupt.
5. As a final step, the friend can ask the witness for further observations or insights about the person.

#### HIGHER SELF

The Higher Self is an archetype that allows us to receive information for healing and guidance towards wholeness. It can be defined as communing with divine intelligence, God or Goddess, disembodied masters who act as guides, or an unconscious aspect of our own mind.

* **Exercise for Guidance from the Higher Self**: 
  - Create a mental image of your concept of deity and describe it to a friend. 
  - Pose a mature question about a difficult situation you're facing. 
  - Switch roles with your friend, imagining yourself as the deity, and answer the question as if you were that higher being.

* **Alone**: 
  - Imagine your concept of God/dess, write down your question on paper, and allow yourself to take on the God/dess form while reading the question. 
  - Answer as you would above, either remembering or recording the answer. 
  - Journal about whatever comes through during the process.

#### NONATTACHMENT

* **Journal Exercise**: Identify object of attachment, its levels, and benefits; listen to stories about loss; assess their accuracy; identify what it's costing you; find reasons for separation; apply lessons in meditation.
* **Meditation**: Soak cells in desired feeling, separate from attachment, thank it for lessons, unhook energy chords, pull energy into appropriate areas, fill emptiness with activities or people.

#### TRANSCENDING THE LOWER EGOS

Opening the crown chakra is like taking off our clothing and experiencing the joy of being naked. The following meditation helps us drop the sheaths of identity associated with the lower chakras and embrace our universal identity.

1. Let go of anything that is not your body. Feel the presence of the resident dweller inside your body, embrace its energy, and thank the body for holding you.
2. Allow yourself to feel the emotions inside your body. See how many of those reactions are automatic, based in emotions, or just physical habits.
3. See yourself interacting with others. See the I that did the work of those creations, and acknowledge all you have done.
4. See yourself as floating on a sea of archetypal energies, riding on the waves as each one peaks and falls. Feel how the culture has influenced the shape of this archetypal flow.
5. Realize that there is still another presence within that has gone on this great ride—one that is separate from the archetypal energy, one that may have ridden many different waves over millennia of lifetimes, and one that can choose which ride to go on. A

llow yourself to expand beyond the earth, beyond the solar system, beyond the galaxy, and feel the connection with all of creation. Embrace the Self that still remains. This is your ultimate reality. Thou Art That.

#### EXAMINING OUR BELIEF SYSTEMS

As we expand our consciousness, our beliefs grow and evolve. The greatest enemy to this expansion is limiting beliefs such as "I can't do it," "It'll never happen," or "It is impossible." We discover that anything is possible when we explore the infinite potential of spirit.

Asking questions like "When did I first get this idea?" and "Where did those thoughts come from at the time?", we can uncover the influences that shaped our beliefs. We can then determine if these beliefs are truly our own or if they were constructed based on external factors.

If we find ourselves confused, ignorant, or unable to think for ourselves, it may be time to seek more information. Information can come from various sources such as teachers, books, institutions, experience, and exploration.

To enhance our seventh chakra, we should feed it with information. This can be done by taking a new course of study or reading new books on subjects that interest us. By learning about ourselves and the world around us, we can master self-knowledge, which is the goal of the seventh chakra.

#### RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY

1. *Religion* is a psychic structure chosen by many as a vehicle for connection, similar to an over-arching operating system with instructions for dealing with the world.
2. Religion can be the activity of the crown chakra and is one of the many petals of the seventh lotus, a powerful psychic structure that either liberates or imprisons our crown chakra.
3. As a belief system, religion can obscure our experience or open us to wider vistas. The drive toward religion comes from each of the chakras.
4. Religion negates spirituality when it becomes a structure for denying feelings, avoiding challenges, controlling others, or ego-inflating righteousness. These are the traps of religion.
5. On the positive side, religion gives us a structure and practice that allows us to let go and open ourselves to deeper states of experience, awareness, and understanding. It also provides community support in times of crisis.
6. Practices such as meditation, singing in a choir, rituals, puja (offering), yoga, or community service ground religious values in real life experience. 

Religion without practice is just a set of ideas and concepts; religion with practice is an active experience that can further the evolution of the soul and world.

## CONCLUSION 

### Restoration of the Sacred 

#### THE MANY SHADES OF THE RAINBOW

The journey from birth to adulthood involves obstacles and difficulties that can lead to trauma, lack of consciousness, and cultural blind spots. However, the archetype of the Self contains a program for becoming whole, similar to how a seed becomes a flower.

**Each piece we reclaim unfolds a petal of a chakra** - Working through past traumas allows us to return to our original pattern and pick up our evolutionary process where it was interrupted. This leads to the reclamation of pieces of our body's reality, which in turn contributes to the restoration of the temple.

**Breaking down barriers** - Breaking through illusions and barriers allows us to experience love and see the truth of our divine nature more clearly. Enlightenment or awakening is not about creating a new state of affairs but recognizing what already exists.

**The goal is not to climb to the crown chakra** - The journey is not about reaching enlightenment quickly, but rather being as conscious as possible at every level and bringing depth and wisdom to each stage. 

The journey does not end with the realization of the soul; it is only the beginning of another voyage made in consciousness instead of ignorance.

#### SRI AUROBINDO

1. **SRI AUROBINDO'S JOURNEY OF CONSCIOUSNESS**: The journey of consciousness begins with an ascent to the top, where pure awareness meets the body and allows us to operate it. As we unfold the chakras developmentally from the base to the crown, our energy evolves into more efficient and complex levels.

2. **THE JOURNEY DOWNWARD**: In the journey downward, we bring higher awareness into lower chakra activities. Instead of forming decisions based on feelings, we can base them on principles and strategies. We create who we are rather than merely discovering it. 

3. **FULL REALIZATION**: When we have fully arrived at the seventh chakra, we have a fully conscious state of being. With understanding gained in the seventh chakra, we not only see the whole but also know what to make of it.

4. **BRINGING CONSCIOUSNESS DOWN**: When we bring consciousness down to the heart chakra, we gain the understanding necessary for compassion. 

5. **POWER AND TRANSFORMATION**: Instead of blindly acting through trial and error, we now use our intelligence to create a strategy. With vision, inspiration, communication, and love, we can energize that plan and direct it with clear intent.

6. **EMOTIONS AND SEXUALITY**: We meet emotions with compassion and express our sexuality with love and communication. The impulse to reach out can now make solid connections with emotional rapport, sensate awareness, new levels of empathy.

7. **MANIFESTATION**: At the base chakra, these qualities become a part of our ability to manifest, where our conception, vision, inspiration, compassion, transformation, and connection enter into physical reality. We bring an expansive awareness deep into the body with love, connection, feeling, and aliveness.

8. **ENLIGHTENMENT**: Enlightenment comes in pieces, happening a little bit every day. Each time we have even a small insight, we gain a piece of wisdom that can be applied wherever it is needed. As we change ourselves, so do we change the world.

### PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. **Assessing Chakras**: Divide a piece of paper into four columns labeled Issues, Strengths, Excess, and Deficiency. Go through each chapter's lists and write down applicable words. Have a friend do an assessment as well for comparison.
2. **Analyzing Patterns**: Look at the assessment results to see which chakras are stronger or weaker. Use strengths from upper chakras to work on lower ones, and address issues in the heart chakra by strengthening lower ones.
3. **Unbalanced Energy Patterns:** There are four basic patterns of unbalanced energy distribution through the chakras: *top-down* (excess in upper chakras), bottom-up (deficiency in lower chakras), inside-out (emotional issues), and outside-in (relationship issues). These patterns can be subtle.
4. **Energy Flow**: Where attention goes, energy follows. Focus on the areas that need improvement to achieve balance.

Use excessive energy to build up deficient energy. If you're strong in the sixth chakra, use it to visualize a healthy body or better relationships. Use communication skills for power and relationships, and discipline for physical exercises or meditation.

#### TOP-DOWN SYSTEMS 
People who live primarily in their heads and deal with the physical world when necessary. They have excessive upper chakras and deficient lower ones. Thinking-intuitive types who think first and act later (if at all), often struggle with spontaneity and playfulness. Growth comes from moving energy downward and connecting with the body.

Top-down people: Suffer from early childhood difficulties that threw them out of their bodies and into their heads. Tend to pick jobs that are intellectual or analytical - teaching, computer programming, writing, counseling, nonperforming arts. They are oriented toward self-reflection and self-expression.

Top-down systems: Result from a strict parent who curtails the natural expansiveness of the child. Parents may punish, ridicule, or restrict creative behavior and experimentation. Some families model this kind of structure, teaching that life's rewards are found only in hard work, obedient behavior, and minimizing expectations.

#### BOTTOM-UP SYSTEMS

Energetically bottom-heavy, they tend to stay in repetitive, familiar patterns of the lower chakras while growth comes from moving energy upward. Feeling/sensate types who are more likely to be ruled by emotions and instincts than cognitive process. They enjoy physical activity such as exercise, sexuality, making things with their hands, cooking, or giving massage.

Bottom-up people: Generally enjoy physical activity such as exercise, sexuality, making things with their hands, cooking, or giving massage. Keep their nose to the grindstone, tend to conform, and are predictable and reliable. Concerned mostly with self-preservation and self-gratification, ruled by the unconscious, often do what they do by impulse, following the path of least resistance.

#### INSIDE-OUT SYSTEMS

* Inside-out systems are centered in the middle ego centers and grow by extending energy downward into the deeper self and upward toward the spirit and intellect. They have overall balance between upper and lower chakras but are poorly connected to either end.
* If middle chakras are blocked, energy is held in the middle of the body and kept from the periphery, evident in Endurer structure.
* Open middle chakras lead to ego- and action-oriented extroverts who like to engage life. They are not interested in their bodies or spiritual matters.

#### OUTSIDE-IN SYSTEMS
Outside-in systems may be acutely aware of both head and body but have a great chasm of emptiness in the middle, especially at the heart. They can be highly sensitive physically with allergies, irritations, or chronic pains.

Their upper chakras are highly developed, making them intelligent, creative, and intuitive. Disconnected from integrative middle, they tend toward introversion.

Traumas may be repressed from memory or serious wounds to the heart in outside-in systems. Growth comes from establishing deep relationships and opening up.

Oral structure can fall into this category as they are collapsed in the heart but can also fall into any of the above categories depending on their defense system. Extreme cases may signify serious dissociations, such as multiple personality disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, or borderline personality disorders.

#### BALANCED SYSTEMS

It is possible to have a relatively balanced chakra system without being an enlightened master. A balanced person would be grounded, in touch with their body, and exhibit good health and vitality. 

They would also be aware of their feelings but not ruled by them, sexually content without being driven, confident and purposeful without dominating others, compassionate and loving yet centered and peaceful, able to communicate clearly and listen to others, and have imagination, wisdom, and a personal connection with spirit.

**When in Doubt, Work from the Ground Up**: Start with grounding exercises when working with someone new, as it helps establish boundaries and focus life energy into the present moment. If the person is too frightened to concentrate on the exercises, start with conversation and historical material gathering. Assign physical tasks like gardening or stretching exercises at home to help ground them.

**Emotions, Thoughts, and Sensations**: As work progresses, emotions may arise, thoughts may bring relevant associations from the past, bodily sensations may become apparent, and dreams during the week can provide direction. If in doubt, wait for these signs to emerge before forcing a healing agenda.

Remember that body, soul, mind, and spirit, along with the seven chakras, are all one indivisible whole. Even when working on a part, all other parts are present and participating. Keep the whole in mind as the guiding archetype of the Self throughout the process.

### KUNDALINI AWAKENING

A yogi should open the gate to liberation with Kundalini, which gives liberation and bondage depending on the individual's state.

**Kundalini in Hindu Mythology**: Kundalini is a serpent goddess who lies asleep at the base of the spine and represents the unfolding of divine energy.

**Circumstances that Stimulate Kundalini Awakening**: Various factors can trigger this awakening, such as meditation, yoga, fasting, stress, trauma, psychedelic drugs, or near-death experiences.

Kundalini energy can be experienced in various ways, including milder and shorter episodes.

This energy is a condensed, primal force that creates a vertical connection between the chakras by opening subtle channels.

**Kundalini as Healing Force**: Although its effects may sometimes be unpleasant, Kundalini is essentially a healing force that can last for minutes, days, months, or years.

**Coping with Unpleasant Symptoms**: To manage these symptoms, one should attend to the body, reduce stress, find support, educate oneself, treat underlying psychological issues, examine spiritual practices, practice grounding, and consider yoga.

**Shiva—Counterpart to Kundalini-Shakti**: Shiva is the Hindu god of destruction who brings realization of eternal consciousness within, while Kundalini-Shakti represents the upward current.

### Shiva

1. Shiva is an archetype with both dark and light forces.
2. In his active principle, he is called Rudra, a fierce destroyer who sears ignorance in a single glance.
3. Rudra was also the lord of song, healing, sacrifices, and prosperity, simultaneously seen as the remover of pain.
4. Later, Rudra was given the name Shiva, meaning Lord of Sleep, representing the "non-dual, undifferentiated state of peace."
5. In this form, he is the ultimate transcendent deity of all knowledge, the merging of the individual with the divine, representing limitless bliss.
6. When enlivened by Shakti, "The dance of Shiva suggests the primordial rhythm of the divine Heart whose pulsation initiates each and every motion on the universe."
7. Together Shiva and Shakti are the primordial emanations of life itself, the cosmic parents inherent in all creation.
8. Shiva is the pure consciousness that meets and tempers the raw, vital energy of Shakti.
9. Shiva represents the piercing nature of consciousness that impregnates the seeker with potent awareness.
10. Shiva can be a tempering force for the violent ravages of Kundalini-Shakti.
11. When we deal with Kundalini, we are dealing with difficult, unrefined, and unconscious energies.
12. As Kundalini rises, she "cooks" the grosser levels into the refinement of the higher chakras.
13. Shiva brings order and peace to her restless wildness.
14. To invoke the energy of Shiva is to call upon the transcendent bliss of the crown chakra and bring it down through the body.
15. The union of these two forces synthesizes the cosmic principles of male and female, upper and lower, form and chaos, transcendence and immanence, into a single dynamic essence.

### TANTRA—MEETING AT THE HEART

1. Tantra is a spiritual practice focused on weaving together opposite energies, specifically Shakti (feminine energy) and Shiva (masculine energy).
2. Sexuality is a subset of Tantra that embodies the union of these two forces on the physical plane.
3. Enlightenment in Tantra is achieved through embracing the full experience of living, delighting in the senses, desires, and feelings.
4. The heart chakra is the central integrating chamber of the chakra system, where all things find connection and wholeness.
5. The world is currently immersed in power struggles and aggression, but it is time to shift focus from the third chakra (individuality) to the fourth (community).
6. Only love can lift us out of violence, aggression, and individualism, and reweave the original fabric of wholeness that has been severed in ourselves and among each other.
7. Each conscious, integrated individual must open their heart to create a living reality between Heaven and Earth through the Rainbow Bridge.

### TEMPLE FOR THE GODS

- Spirituality is awakening divinity in consciousness.
- In Norse mythology, giants built palace Valhalla as abode for gods; they requested payment (Frejya, goddess of love).
- We cannot have others build our temple for us or pay for it by sacrificing love.
- If we want divine energies to manifest within us, we must build our own temple.
- Consciousness is universal field accessed through individual psyche; amount of consciousness depends on intelligence and state of mind.
- Divinity is more than just consciousness; it includes beauty, sound, love, energy, feeling, and form (reflected in each chakra).
- To tap into full spectrum of divinity, we need to build temple within ourselves capable of receiving/transmitting each frequency.
- Each chakra represents essential chamber in temple of Self; houses aspect of sacred and is necessary for wholeness.
- More we clean/properly decorate temple, more we court presence of divine.
- Build temple to gods by creating, clearing, restoring each chakra's chamber.
- Once we open to gods, our job is to bring them forward through sacred living and enhance journey for others.
- Only by going on journey ourselves can we guide others; thus, journey across Rainbow Bridge becomes sacred quest for evolution of humanity.
