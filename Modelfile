MESSAGE user ```This new understanding of the multifaceted roles of the cranial nerves, and particularly their connection with the state of social engagement, enabled me to consistently help more people with an even wider range of health issues. All I had to do was to determine whether these five cranial nerves functioned well and, if not, to use a technique to get them to function better. This made it possible for me to achieve far greater success in my practice and to treat intransigent conditions such as migraine headaches, depression, fibromyalgia, COPD, post-traumatic stress, forward head posture, and neck and shoulder problems, among others. This book is an introduction to the theory and practice of Polyvagal healing. After describing basic neurological structures, I will list some of the physical, psychological, and social issues caused by dysfunctions of those five cranial nerves. According to the Polyvagal Theory, the autonomic nervous system has two other functions in addition to those of the ventral branch of the vagus nerve: the activity of the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve, and sympathetic activity from the spinal chain. This multiple (poly-) nature of the vagus nerve gives the theory its name. The differences between the functions of the ventral and dorsal branches of the vagus nerve have profound implications for physical and behavioral health and healing. Throughout the book, I propose a new approach to healing that includes self-help exercises and hands-on therapeutic techniques that are simple to learn and easy to use. It is my hope that this knowledge will continue to spread and enable many more people to help themselves and others. RESTORING SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT I have written this book to make the benefits of restoring vagal function available to a broad range of people, even if they have no prior experience with craniosacral or other forms of hands-on therapy. Readers can acquire a unique set of easy-to-learn and easy-to-do self-help exercises and hands-on techniques that should enable them to improve the function of these five nerves in themselves and others. I used the principles behind Alain Gehin's work to develop these techniques. The exercises and techniques restore flexibility to the functioning of the autonomic nervous system. They can help eliminate the general adverse conditions of chronic stress, which arises from the overstimulation of the spinal sympathetic chain, and depressive behavior and shut-down, which arise from activity in the dorsal vagal circuit. The exercises are noninvasive and do not involve medicine or surgery.``` \nThe content between backticks is a subsection of a book-chapter. write 8-11 words describing it.

MESSAGE user ```The BwO is desire; it is that which one desires and by which one desires. And not only because it is the plane of consistency or the field of immanence of desire. Even when it falls into the void of too-sudden destra-tification, or into the proliferation of a cancerous stratum, it is still desire. Desire stretches that far: desiring one's own annihilation, or desiring the power to annihilate. Money, army, police, and State desire, fascist desire, even fascism is desire. There is desire whenever there is the constitution of a BwO under one relation or another. It is a problem not of ideology but of pure matter, a phenomenon of physical, biological, psychic, social, or cosmic matter. That is why the material problem confronting schizoanalysis is knowing whether we have it within our means to make the selection, to distinguish the BwO from its doubles: empty vitreous bodies, cancerous bodies, totalitarian and fascist. The test of desire: not denouncing false desires, but distinguishing within desire between that which pertains to stratic proliferation, or else too-violent destratification, and that which pertains to the construction of the plane of consistency (keep an eye out for all that is fascist, even inside us, and also for the suicidal and the demented). The plane of consistency is not simply that which is constituted by the sum of all BwO's. There are things it rejects; the BwO chooses, as a function of the abstract machine that draws it. Even within a BwO (the masochist body, the drugged body, etc. ), we must distinguish what can be composed on the plane and what cannot. There is a fascist use of drugs, or a suicidal use, but is there also a possible use that would be in conformity with the plane of consistency? Even paranoia: Is there a possibility of using it that way in part? When we asked the question of the totality of all BwO's, considered as substantial attributes of a single substance, it should have been understood, strictly speaking, to apply only to the plane. The plane is the totality of the full BwO's that have been selected (there is no positive totality including the cancerous or empty bodies). What is the nature of this totality? Is it solely logical? Or must we say that each BwO, from a basis in its own genus, produces effects identical or analogous to the effects other BwO's produce from a basis in their genera? Could what the drug user or masochist obtains also be obtained in a different fashion in the conditions of the plane, so it would even be possible to use drugs without using drugs, to get soused on pure water, as in Henry Miller's experimentations? Or is it a question of a real passage of substances, an intensive continuum of all the BwO's? Doubtless, anything is possible. All we are saying is that the identity of effects, the continuity of genera, the totality of all BwO's, can be obtained on the plane of consistency only by means of an abstract machine capable of covering and even creating it, by assemblages capable of plugging into desire, of effectively taking charge of desires, of assuring their continuous connections and transversal tie-ins. Otherwise, the BwO's of the plane will remain separated by genus, marginalized, reduced to means of bordering, while on the other plane the emptied or cancerous doubles will triumph.``` \nThe content between backticks is a subsection of a book-chapter. write 8-11 words describing it.
