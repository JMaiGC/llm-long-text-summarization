  "prompt": "summarize the following: The parallel between affecting the underlying neural platform or guna state is significant in enabling yoga therapy to be practiced in a manner consistent with its philosophical foundations while being translatable to current neurophysiological thinking. The ability to utilize the existing explanatory framework provided by yoga and the gunas combined with the biobehavioral model established by Polyvagal Theory enables the translation of yoga therapy into health care and research without the need to adopt an outside neurophysiological model and attempt to fit yoga into that model. This work will contribute to yoga therapy being understood as a distinct health care profession that benefits physiological, psychological, and behavioral well-being for diverse patient populations through the cultivation of self-regulatory skills, resilience, and eudaemonic well-being. This model provides support for the creation of yoga therapy assessment tools to identify underlying guna predominance. In addition, it supports the yoga therapist in evaluating, assessing, and creating interventions aimed at working with underlying guna predominance and identifiable and measurable neural platforms toward these goals. Rather than creating protocols for allopathic conditions, the yoga therapist influences these underlying guna states and neural platforms to target the unique needs of each individual. Bridge-building efforts such as this work would support yoga therapists, who work with clients in a manner that is simultaneously based on yoga foundational theory and offers additional translatory language for research, the public, and integration into health care.",
