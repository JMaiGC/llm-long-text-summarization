**Topic:** Communication Strategies for Managing Conflicts with Intimate Partner

**Key Concepts:** Empathy, Active Listening, Clear Communication, Misunderstandings

**Background:** The speaker is discussing communication issues in their relationship and the importance of empathy, active listening, clear communication, and avoiding misunderstandings.

**Empathy:**
- Empathy is essential when trying to change someone's behavior (even in extreme cases like prison inmates)
- Start by understanding their needs and motivations
- Show them that their behavior is precious and important to you

**Clear Communication:**
- Be honest about your feelings and needs
- Use "I" statements instead of accusatory language
- Encourage the other person to share their perspective
- Validate their feelings and needs

**Misunderstandings:**
- Misunderstandings can lead to arguments and conflict
- Avoid assuming that the other person's reaction is based on what you said
- Use active listening skills to clarify misunderstandings
- Acknowledge and validate their perspective, even if it differs from yours

**Specific Situation:**
- The speaker and their partner argue frequently when they get together
- The speaker wants the partner to be happy but feels that just being told to "be happy" is not helpful
- The partner often tries to control the speaker's plans, which causes anxiety

**Strategies for Handling Specific Situation:**
- Instead of telling the partner to be happy, identify specific actions they can take to feel more confident and in control
- When the partner is in a bad mood, empathize with their feelings instead of demanding that they change their mood to suit the speaker
- When planning a trip, find a way to communicate clearly about the speaker's need for independence while also acknowledging the partner's concern for their wellbeing.

**Quotes:**
- "Just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind."
- "Empathy starts by empathizing with what mother's intent in behaving as she does."
- "I'd like you to hear it differently, I'd like you to just hear my needs."
- "Just about three ear-pulls and I got it right? Now there're some eight-pull jackals, too, but I can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal."

### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

**Topic:** Enjoying Suffering: Releasing Responsibility and Embracing Empathy

**Key Concept:** The ability to enjoy suffering involves releasing oneself from two kinds of responsibility: the belief that one caused another person's pain and the feeling that it is one's duty to fix their pain.

**Releasing Responsibility:**

* **Not causing the pain:** In this scenario, a friend expresses feelings of inadequacy compared to others. To enjoy their suffering, one must first release oneself from the responsibility of having caused their pain. Since the friend did not accuse the listener of being at fault, it is easy for the listener to let go of this feeling.
* **Not responsible for fixing the pain:** The second and more challenging aspect is recognizing that it is not one's duty to fix another person's pain. When someone expresses their suffering, there can be a natural inclination to want to help or offer solutions. However, attempting to do so may actually worsen the situation.

**Empathy and Healing:**

* **Presence and empathy:** To help the healing process, one should focus on being present with the person in their suffering. This means listening attentively without judgment or offering unsolicited advice. By simply being there for them, a precious connection is formed, which is what the speaker refers to as "enjoyment."
* **Healing energy:** There is a powerful healing energy that can work through us when we are present with someone in their suffering. This energy cannot be harnessed when one tries to fix things or offer solutions. Instead, it flows more freely when we allow ourselves to empathize and connect with the person on a deeper level.
* **Blocking the energy:** We block this healing energy by trying to fix things or give advice. When we step in and attempt to "help," we may unintentionally make things worse. By being present and allowing the person to process their emotions, we create an environment for the natural healing process to occur.
* **Example:** In the given scenario, if someone expresses feelings of discouragement and frustration about not achieving more in life, simply being present with them without trying to offer solutions or advice can lead to a precious connection that facilitates healing.

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

**Empathizing vs. Encouraging and Supporting:**

- Empathizing refers to understanding and sharing another person's feelings and experiences.
- Encouraging and supporting someone who is suffering can take different forms.
- Subtle encouragement in the context of this text refers to listening attentively and providing emotional support.

**Listening vs. Keeping the Soap Opera Going:**

- Listening to someone's story about their past experiences is a form of empathizing and supporting.
- However, if the person keeps repeating the same story without making progress towards healing, it can be considered keeping the "soap opera" going.
- This can hinder the healing process as the person becomes stuck in the past.

**Interrupting vs. Healing:**

- Interrupting someone while they are talking about their past experiences may seem counterintuitive to empathizing and supporting.
- However, interrupting can be an effective way to bring the conversation to the present moment and stimulate healing.
- By acknowledging the emotions underlying the story and focusing on what is alive in the person now, they are less likely to keep dwelling on the past.

**Healing through Present Moment Connection:**

- Healing does not come from talking about the past endlessly.
- Instead, healing occurs when we connect with what is alive in us in the present moment, which can be stimulated by the past experiences.
- By interrupting and bringing the conversation to the present moment, the person can begin to heal.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 

**Emotional Pain and Stimuli**

- The ability of someone else to cause emotional pain is not absolute as individuals have control over their own reactions.
- Personal experiences and family background shape emotional responses.
- Different people react differently to the same stimulus.

**Examples from Work Experience**

- In Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone:
  - Some individuals harbor deep rage and live for vengeance.
  - Others have no anger despite similar experiences.

**Individual Responsibility vs. Accountability**

- Individuals are responsible for their emotional reactions to stimuli.
- The person causing harm is accountable for their actions.

**Working with Trauma Survivors**

- Different reactions to trauma:
  - Rage and vengeance.
  - Deep shame.
  - Other emotions.
- Empathy and understanding are crucial before teaching coping mechanisms.
- Helping individuals change their perspective to minimize unnecessary pain.

**The Concept of Debt Jackal**

- A term used in the context of emotional healing.
- Refers to the inner voice that tells us we owe others for their suffering or our own.
- Encourages individuals to take on unnecessary guilt and responsibility, creating more pain.

**Non-Violent Communication (NVC) and Celebration**

* NVC is not only about conflict resolution but also about celebration and expressing gratitude
* Celebration provides fuel to stay true to our nature in a "jackalish" world
* Fuel comes from saying thank you in the form of genuine expression of gratitude

**Jackals and Praise/Compliments**

* Jackals use praise/compliments as moralistic judgments and rewards
* Reinforces the idea that negative exists and implies the speaker is the judge
* Destroys the beauty of thank you when used as a manipulation tool
* Studies on praise in management and education show short-term effects

**Giraffe's Expression of Gratitude**

* Bring to person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful
	+ Concrete example of the impact on our lives
	+ Avoid vague generality or telling someone what they are
* Share how we feel at that moment about the person having done that
* Identify the need of the person that was fulfilled by our actions

**Examples of Giraffe Gratitude**

* A woman in Geneva, Switzerland, expressing gratitude to Marshall:
	+ Concrete example: what I did
	+ Share feelings: hopeful and relieved
	+ Identify need: direction to connect with her son
