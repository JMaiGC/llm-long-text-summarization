TEXT: i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal

### i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappr



1. Situation with intimate partner:
   - Need for partner to be happy (undesirable)
   - Partner keeps telling the speaker to be happy
   - Speaker wants actionable steps to achieve happiness
   - Speaker doesn't want to go somewhere if partner is not in a good mood
   - Anxiety about planning a trip with mother

2. Communication strategies:
   - Start by empathizing with the other person's intent and needs
   - Express honestly how you feel and your needs
   - Avoid saying \"you misunderstood me\" or \"that isn't what I said\"
   - Thank the person for their perspective, even if it's different from yours
   - Repeat your message until they understand it correctly

### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 



1. Enjoying suffering:
   - Release ourselves from two kinds of responsibility:
     - Not causing the pain (especially if the person is trying to make us believe we did)
     - Fixing it to make the person feel better (as we can't fix people)
   - Empathy and presence are key:
     - Don't do something, stand there
     - Remember Buddhist advice: don't do something, be present
     - Energy works through us when we are present
     - Precious connection between the person and us
2. Blocking energy:
   - Trying to fix things ourselves (advice, etc.)
3. Helping energy work:
   - Empathy requires presence
   - Just be present without trying to fix things
4. Example of enjoying suffering:
   - Person is discouraged and frustrated with their life choices
   - Not trying to fix it but being present creates a precious connection

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is



1. Empathizing vs Encouraging/Supporting:
   - Empathy is understanding someone else's feelings without necessarily agreeing with them or sharing their experiences.
   - Encouraging and supporting involves actively helping someone through a difficult situation, providing guidance and reassurance.

2. Subtle Encouragement:
   - When someone is suffering, being there for them can be seen as a subtle encouragement to continue talking about their problems.
   - This type of encouragement may not always be helpful in the long run, as it can perpetuate the cycle of discussing past issues rather than focusing on healing.

3. Healing vs Talking About the Past:
   - Healing involves moving forward and addressing current needs and emotions, rather than dwelling on past events.
   - By interrupting conversations about the past and redirecting them to focus on present feelings and experiences, one can encourage a more productive healing process.

4. Interrupting Conversations:
   - Interrupting conversations about the past is not meant to dismiss or invalidate someone's experiences but rather to shift the focus towards healing.
   - By acknowledging the pain caused by past events and redirecting the conversation to present emotions, one can help the person move towards a more positive state of mind.

5. Healing Through Present Emotions:
   - Healing occurs when individuals are able to process their current emotions and experiences in relation to past events.
   - By focusing on what is alive in them right now, rather than dwelling on the past, people can begin to heal and move forward.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 



Title: The Role of Emotional Reactions and Accountability in Dealing with Painful Experiences

1. Introduction:
   - Discussion on the impact of emotional reactions to painful experiences.
   - Recognition that stimuli do not determine our emotional responses; it is up to us how we react.
   - Examples from Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone illustrate different emotional reactions to similar stimuli.

2. Emotional Reactions:
   - Stimulus vs. Response: The same stimulus can lead to different emotional reactions depending on the individual's perspective.
   - Examples from Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone demonstrate how people respond differently to similar situations.
   - Some individuals may feel shame, rage, or other emotions in response to a painful experience.

3. Accountability:
   - The person responsible for the stimulus is accountable for their actions and intentions.
   - However, it is important not to blame the victim for how they reacted to the situation.
   - The focus should be on helping individuals deal with their emotional reactions in a way that minimizes further pain and suffering.

4. Teaching Emotional Responses:
   - It is crucial to provide empathy and support to children who have experienced painful events before teaching them how to respond emotionally.
   - The goal should be to help the child see their situation in a way that minimizes unnecessary pain and suffering.
   - This process may take time, but it is essential for the child's well-being.

### okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get t



1. Non-violent Communication (NVC) is not solely interested in conflict resolution but also in celebration.
2. Celebration comes from expressing gratitude and saying thank you.
3. Jackals use praise or compliments as a reward, which destroys the beauty of thank you.
4. Giraffes express gratitude by bringing to the person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful for them, stating how they feel at that moment about the person having done it, and seeing how their need was fulfilled by the action.

### it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now ove



1. Importance of receiving gratitude:
   - Jackal expresses gratitude towards someone who offered him a ride.
   - Gratitude is a way to show love and appreciation.
   - Expressing sincere gratitude can be more effective than terrorizing someone.

2. Dangerous concept of \"deserve\":
   - Jackals have a dangerous concept in their head called \"deserve\".
   - This concept implies that one has to deserve appreciation or punishment based on behavior.
   - Believing in the concept of \"deserve\" can lead to setting up destructive economic and correctional systems.

3. Fear of receiving gratitude:
   - Jackals get scared when they hear gratitude because they think they don't deserve it.
   - This fear is rooted in self-hatred and the belief that there's something wrong with them.
   - The Course of Miracles states that our light, not darkness, scares us most.

4. Humility:
   - There are different kinds of humility, and jackals may have a dangerous kind.
   - Golda Meir, an Israeli Prime Minister, said not to be so humble if you're not great.
   - The main reason for fearing gratitude is the belief that we don't deserve it.

5. Celebrating gratitude:
   - Gratitude should come from the heart and never be used as a way to praise, compliment, or reward someone.
   - It's important to celebrate and not just praise others.
