### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

Enjoying Suffering: Overcoming Responsibility and Learning to Empathize

1. Understanding suffering: The text discusses the idea of enjoying someone's suffering by understanding that we must release ourselves from two types of responsibility - not causing the pain and not being responsible for fixing it.

2. Causing psychological pain: It is crucial to remember that we cannot cause another person's psychological pain, as this can lead to a misguided sense of responsibility.

3. Empathy and presence: To help someone in pain, we must be empathetic and present without trying to fix their problems. This allows the healing energy to work through us and create a precious connection with the person in need.

4. Blocking the healing energy: We often block this powerful healing energy by attempting to fix things ourselves, which can make the situation worse.

5. The role of advice: Offering advice or trying to provide solutions can hinder the healing process and weaken the precious connection between individuals. Instead, being present and allowing the natural flow of energy is essential for true empathy and enjoyment in these situations.

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

**Distinction between Empathizing, Encouraging, and Supporting**
1. Empathy: Understanding someone's feelings or situation without necessarily encouraging them to continue discussing their past experiences.
2. Encouragement: Subtly promoting the continuation of a story or conversation about the past.
3. Support: Providing emotional assistance while focusing on the present and future healing process.

**Healing Process and Conversation Interruption**
1. Past-focused conversations: Keeping the focus on past events may not lead to significant healing, as it can prolong the suffering.
2. Present-focused approach: Encouraging individuals to discuss their feelings and experiences in relation to the present moment, stimulated by past events, promotes healing.
3. Interrupting conversations: By interrupting when someone is talking about the past, the listener can redirect the conversation towards the present emotions and needs, ultimately fostering a more effective healing process.
4. Moving forward: Addressing the current situation and feelings stimulated by past experiences allows individuals to heal and grow, rather than dwelling on the past.
5. Last question and subject change: After redirecting the conversation, the listener can ask a final question related to the past before transitioning into a new topic or discussion. This helps maintain focus on healing and growth while acknowledging the importance of understanding the individual's experiences.
