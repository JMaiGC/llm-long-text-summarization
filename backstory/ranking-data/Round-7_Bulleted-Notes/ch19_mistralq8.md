## Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

**Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900**

**Introduction:**
- Rapid urbanization in the late 19th century due to industrialization and immigration.
- New opportunities but also challenges for millions seeking a better future.
- Sadie Frowne's experience of arriving in America and facing the realities of urban life.

**19.1 Urbanization and Its Challenges:**

* **Urbanization:**
  + Rapid growth due to industrialization, new technologies, and immigration.
  + Attraction of employment opportunities leading to massive population growth in cities.
  + Cities became economic and cultural resources for immigrants.

* **Challenges of Urban Life:**
  + Low wages, long hours, monotonous work.
  + Overcrowded buildings, poor sanitation, widespread disease.
  + Language, class, race, and ethnicity barriers.

**Urbanization Factors:**
* New technologies: steam engine, electric lights, powerful machinery, telephones.
* Industrialization: factories relocated to urban centers, longer work hours.
* Immigration: wave of immigrants from Europe seeking better opportunities.

**Impact of Urbanization:**
* Population growth in urban areas (Figure 19.3).
* Cities developed unique industries and characters.
* Issues with housing, transportation, communication, deep class inequalities, racial divisions, religious differences, ethnic strife, and corrupt local politics.

**Keys to Successful Urbanization:**
1. **Electric Lighting:**
   * Transformed how people lived by providing constant light through Edison's incandescent bulb and the AC system developed by Tesla.
   * Facilitated round-the-clock factory production and economic growth, leading to more jobs and urban expansion.
2. **Communication Improvements:**
   * Telephone made long-distance communication faster than telegraph.
   * Allowed for constant demand generation and increased business pace, requiring additional labor and urban growth.
3. **Intracity Transportation:**
   * Urban population growth required efficient transportation solutions within cities to accommodate more people and goods.
4. **The Rise of Skyscrapers:**
   * Innovations in construction materials and techniques made tall buildings possible.
   * Facilitated office space for growing businesses, further driving urbanization.

**Urban Challenges:**
* Absence of basic urban infrastructures (better transportation, adequate housing, communication, and efficient sources of light and energy).
* Lack of fresh water and proper sanitation.
* Deep class inequalities, racial divisions, religious differences, and ethnic strife.
* Corrupt local politics.

### Intracity Transportation

**Intracity Transportation:**

* As cities grew, efficient travel within them became a challenge.
* Most transportation infrastructure focused on connecting cities by rail or canal.
* Horse-drawn omnibuses were common for intracity transportation before the 1880s.
* Omnibuses had limitations in handling larger crowds and dealing with horse manure.
* Electric trolleys, powered by electricity instead of horses, were introduced in 1887.
* Cable cars were used in cities like San Francisco to navigate steep hills.
* L-trains (elevated trains) were developed to avoid overcrowded streets in larger cities.
* Subways emerged as the next step for underground transportation.

**The Rise of Skyscrapers:**

* Large cities needed to find solutions for the ever-increasing need for space.
* Geographic limitations and the prestige of tall buildings led to upward growth.
* The first skyscraper was completed in Chicago in 1885, but elevators were required for taller structures.
* Electric elevators were introduced in 1889 by the Otis Elevator Company.

**Jacob Riis and How the Other Half Lives:**

* Jacob Riis was a Danish immigrant who documented the living conditions of New York's working poor.
* He published his findings in the book "How the Other Half Lives" (1890), using compelling photographs to shock the public.
* Riis advocated for better living conditions, reforming laws, and building new tenements.

**Immediate Challenges of Urban Life:**

* Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent problems in urban centers.
* Living conditions for working-class urban dwellers were atrocious with overcrowded tenements and substandard plumbing/sanitation.
* Diseases like typhoid and cholera spread easily due to poor living conditions.
* Cities introduced sewage pumping systems in the late 1880s for efficient waste management.
* Churches, civic organizations, settlement houses, and community services provided relief and support for the urban poor.

**The Settlement House Movement:**

* Pioneering women like Jane Addams and Lillian Wald led the settlement house movement in the 1890s.
* Settlement houses offered childcare, evening classes, libraries, gym facilities, and free healthcare to working-class communities.
* The settlement house movement later influenced political agendas, leading to housing laws, child labor laws, and worker’s compensation laws.
* Florence Kelley, Julia Lathrop, and other settlement house workers became influential leaders in women's suffrage and antiwar movements.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

**Factors Leading to African American and European Immigration to American Cities:**

* **African Americans:** Push factors: racial hatred, violence, and lynchings in the South. Pull factors: job opportunities, freedom from violence, and the chance to vote.
* **European Immigrants:** Push factors: famines, religious, political, or racial persecution, or avoidance of compulsory military service. Pull factors: consistent wage-earning work.

**The African American "Great Migration"**

* Between 1865 and 1900, nearly two million African Americans left the South for urban areas in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.
* Primary destinations included New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Indianapolis.
* Push factors: racial hatred, violence, and lack of opportunities in the South. Pull factors: job opportunities, freedom from violence, and the chance to vote.
* African Americans faced discrimination and were relegated to menial jobs.
* Most worked in steel mills, mines, construction, meat packing industries, as porters or servants, janitors, waiters, cooks, garment industry workers, or domestic help.
* African American women faced additional discrimination due to gender.
* Previous waves of immigrants from northern and western Europe had the funds and education to move west and settle on land.

**New European Immigration**

* Over 80% of New York's population was foreign-born or children of foreign-born parents by 1890.
* Massive wave of immigration between 1900 and 1910, with over nine million people arriving.
* Ellis Island opened in 1892 as the primary port of entry for European immigrants.
* Immigrants faced discrimination due to their appearance, language, religions, and unfamiliar foods.
* Growing numbers of Americans resented new immigrants, leading to a backlash and anti-immigration legislation.
* The American Protective Association was formed to promote immigration restrictions and successfully lobbied for an English language literacy test (1917) and the Chinese Exclusion Act (previously discussed).
* Subsequent Emergency Quota Act of 1921, Immigration Act of 1924, and National Origins Act were influenced by the American Protective Association's lobbying efforts.

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

**Section 19.3: Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life**

* Three classes of Americans responded differently to urban life challenges: working class, middle class, and upper class

**The Working Class**

* Machine politics provided relief through local politicians who addressed immediate needs in exchange for votes

**The Middle Class**

* Higher education opportunities and suburbanization provided relief for the emerging professional middle class

**The Upper Class**

* Wealthy urban elites sought refined pastimes to remind themselves of their elevated status
* Cultural pursuits like classical music concerts, fine art collections, and social gatherings became ways to distinguish themselves from the working class
* New forms of transportation, vacations, European travel, and exclusive clubs offered relief as they set themselves further apart in society

**Machine Politics**

* Working-class residents relied on machine politics for immediate solutions to everyday problems
* Favors were exchanged for votes, creating an inefficient but effective system

* Exclusive clubs, vacations, European travel, and steamship trips offered relief as they set themselves further apart in society

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

**Emergence of the Middle Class**
- Middle class responded to urban challenges with education and suburbanization
- Included managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, accountants, etc.

- Escaped city through suburbs as transportation improved

**Suburbanization**
- Large communities connected to urban centers through improved transportation
- Ability to travel from home to work quickly and cheaply encouraged suburban living
- Perception that living farther from the city equated to greater affluence
- Few suburbs existed prior to 1880s, but growth increased with electric railway
- Henry Ford's popularization of automobiles further boosted suburban life in the 20th century
- Interstate highway system and federal housing legislation continued suburban expansion

**New Roles for Middle-Class Women**
- Social norms encouraged women to create positive home environment for husbands and children
- Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping magazines capitalized on this focus
- Middle-class women took on expected roles of housewife and homemaker, but some attended college
- Women's colleges opened between 1865 and 1880, offering higher education and opportunities to work outside the home

**Education and the Middle Class**
- Children of middle class did not have to leave school to work, enabling greater education and advancement
- Stay-at-home mothers enabled more focus on education
- Public school enrollment exploded, with larger schools employing different teachers for each grade
- High schools grew in number and size, offering a wider range of courses
- Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 provided funding and land for affordable, practical education

- City Beautiful movement championed progressive reforms to improve quality of life for city dwellers
- Olmsted and Burnham introduced the idea at the Columbian Exposition in 1893 with "White City" example
- Principles: create larger park areas, build wider boulevards, add more suburbs.

**Key Concepts:**
- Middle class
- Suburbanization
- Education
- Women's roles
- City Beautiful movement
