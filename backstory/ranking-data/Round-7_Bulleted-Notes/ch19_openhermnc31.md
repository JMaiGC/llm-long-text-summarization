### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

Chapter 19: The Growing Pains of Urbanization (1870-1900)
Introduction: The arrival of immigrants in the United States during this period faced challenges and a wondrous world of opportunities. Many had to adapt to life in bustling cities with overcrowding, poor sanitation, and widespread disease.

Urbanization and Its Challenges: The rapid growth of American cities in the late 19th century was due to technological advancements (steam engine, electric lighting), industrialization, and immigration from Europe. People moved to urban areas for job opportunities, but often faced low wages, long hours, dangerous work conditions, language barriers, class inequalities, racism, and cultural differences.

Keys to Successful Urbanization: Four innovations significantly shaped the urban centers - electric lighting, communication improvements (telephone), intracity transportation, and skyscrapers. These developments addressed some urban issues but also fueled growth and change.

Urban Infrastructure Challenges: Basic necessities like transportation, housing, communication, clean water, and sanitation were difficult to provide for the rapidly increasing urban population. Technological advancements such as electric lighting, telephones, and improved transportation systems aided in addressing these issues but also contributed to further urban growth and expansion.

### Intracity Transportation

Intracity Transportation: As cities expanded and populations grew, efficient travel within cities became a major challenge. Previously, most transportation infrastructure focused on connecting cities. Horses were the primary mode for omnibuses, which were large carriages placed on iron or steel tracks to provide smoother rides. They were unable to handle crowded urban settings and faced challenges like horse manure buildup. In 1887, Frank Sprague invented the electric trolley, powered by electricity instead of horses, which provided round-the-clock service but still struggled in densely populated areas. Cities started elevating trolleys above streets to form elevated train or L-train systems, like New York City's in 1868 and Boston's in 1892. This was followed by the rise of underground subways, beginning with Boston's in 1897.

The Rise of Skyscrapers: Cities sought solutions for growing land scarcity by focusing on upward expansion. Steel construction techniques enabled taller buildings, but they required elevators to make them viable. James Otis introduced the first electric elevator in 1889, leading to the skyscraper craze.

Challenges of Urban Life: Overcrowding, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent issues in cities. Living conditions for working-class urban dwellers were poor with tenement houses being common. Jacob Riis's documentation of these living conditions led to new state legislation addressing the situation. Churches, settlement houses, and organizations like the Salvation Army and YMCA offered some relief.

Settlement House Movement: Women like Jane Addams and Lillian Wald led this progressive reform movement, creating community centers that provided aid to working-class women and their families through programs such as childcare, libraries, and health care services. This work laid the groundwork for political agendas, including housing laws, child labor laws, and worker's compensation laws.

Notable Figures: Jane Addams was a social activist known for founding Hull House in Chicago and her influence on the settlement house movement. She also played a role in the women's suffrage and peace movements. Jacob Riis was an immigrant who documented squalid living conditions in New York City's tenements, leading to change through public awareness and new legislation. Frank Sprague invented the electric trolley that revolutionized urban transportation. James Otis introduced the electric elevator, making skyscrapers possible.

Key Terms: Omnibus, Elevated train (L-train), Subway, Skyscraper, Tenement, Settlement House, Sewage Pumping System, Social Gospel, Reverend Washington Gladden, Children's Bureau, Suffrage Movement.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

Headings:
- African American "Great Migration"
- New European Immigration in America
- Discrimination and Anti-immigration Legislation

Key Concepts & Terms:
- African American Great Migration
- Push and pull factors in migration
- Southern and Eastern European immigrants
- Northern and Western European immigrants
- Ellis Island
- Bureau of Immigration
- Dillingham Commission
- Discrimination against immigrants and African Americans
- English language literacy test
- Chinese Exclusion Act
- Emergency Quota Act of 1921
- Immigration Act of 1924
- National Origins Act

Summary Points:
1. The Great Migration saw nearly two million African Americans leave the rural South for urban centers like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia between the end of the Civil War and the start of the Great Depression.
2. Both push and pull factors influenced this migration, with African Americans escaping violence and seeking opportunities in the North.
3. European immigrants also arrived in the late 19th century, initially from Northern and Western Europe, but later from Southern and Eastern Europe due to various push and pull factors.
4. Immigration peaked around 1900-1910 with over nine million arrivals and Ellis Island processing a majority of these immigrants.
5. Discrimination against immigrants was high due to differences in skin tone, language, religion, and cultural practices. Immigrants were blamed for various societal issues.
6. Reverend Josiah Strong's book and the American Protective Association fueled anti-immigrant sentiment, leading to legislation such as English language literacy tests, Chinese Exclusion Act, and eventually the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and Immigration Act of 1924.
7. The National Origins Act aimed to control immigration based on national quotas rather than ethnicity, further emphasizing the societal prejudice against certain groups during this time period. <|im_end|>

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

19.3 Relief from Urban Life Chaos: Different Classes' Responses
- Working class: Machine politics, popular culture (amusement parks, vaudeville, nickelodeons)
- Middle class: Higher education opportunities and suburbanization
- Upper class: Reminders of elite status through exclusive entertainment, high culture, Social Register

Urban Life Struggles of the Working Class
- Machine politics provided timely solutions for citizens and votes for politicians in exchange for favors.
- Popular culture (amusement parks, vaudeville, nickelodeons, baseball) offered an escape from squalor and daily struggles.
- Professional sports like baseball and prize-fighting also served as a common ground for working-class Americans to bond over.

Upper Class in Urban Centers
- Elite citizens often sought refined pastimes such as classical music concerts, fine art collections, and social gatherings.
- Cultural pursuits became a way for upper class to distinguish themselves amid urban chaos.
- Travel (vacations, trips abroad) and maintaining "old money" status were also methods of asserting elite identity.

Middle Class Responses to Urban Life
- Higher education opportunities and suburbanization provided relief and upward mobility for the middle class.
- Machine politics had less direct impact on this group due to their higher socioeconomic standing.
- They generally faced fewer challenges than working or upper classes in urban environments.

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

New Middle Class: The emerging middle class responded to urban challenges with their own solutions, including education and suburbanization. They were composed of professionals like managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, accountants, etc., better educated and compensated than the working-class poor. This group found relief from city life through expanding education and moving to suburbs. The electric railway played a significant role in encouraging suburban living, as it provided affordable transportation. Ford's Model T car further facilitated this move.

New Roles for Middle-Class Women: During the late nineteenth century, women embraced traditional gender roles, focusing on home environment, children, and family spirituality. Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping magazines emerged to cater to their interests. Some women also began attending college or pursued careers as teachers, professors, or in settlement houses.

Education and the Middle Class: The professional class had more time for education due to not having to support their families. Public school enrollment tripled from 7 million in 1870 to 21 million in 1920. Higher education also expanded with land-grant colleges (created by Morrill Acts) providing affordable options for middle-class students. College curricula shifted towards preparing students for professions, reflecting the changing workforce needs.

City Beautiful Movement: As urban sprawl and poor living conditions became more evident, leaders sought to improve city aesthetics, sanitation, and infrastructure through initiatives like wider boulevards and larger park areas. The "White City" at Columbian Exposition set a precedent for urban planning with its focus on cleanliness, green spaces, and modern transportation services. This movement influenced city development well into the twentieth century.

In the late 19th century, rapid social changes impacted Americans, including urbanization, technology advancements, and the growth of big business. This era produced notable writers who explored these transformations through their works, whether fiction or nonfiction. Understanding Charles Darwin's theory of evolution led to social progress discussions and debates on Social Darwinism, while thinkers like Herbert Spencer advanced survival-of-the-fittest ideas.
Realism in literature became prominent, as writers portrayed real life scenes and issues, such as poverty, urbanization, or the Civil War. Notable authors from this period included Mark Twain, Jack London, Kate Chopin, and others. Some even explored naturalist themes, like Jack London's The Call of the Wild.
During this time, various critics emerged, expressing concerns about the industrial age's direction. Authors like Edward Bellamy, Henry George, and Thorstein Veblen critiqued the capitalist model and argued for alternatives such as socialism or equal land ownership. These diverse perspectives contributed to societal understanding and discussions around American changes during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
