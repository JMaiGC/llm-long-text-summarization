The basic right of the heart chakra— to love and be loved—is simple, profound, direct. Sadly, this chakra is easily damaged, diminished, or wounded. These wounds have profound importance as they wound both spirit and soul, a ect both mind and body, and impact the very core of the self. Why is love so elusive when it is so simple? Literature abounds with sagas of love and its loss, sagas we know only too well from personal experience. Nothing is quite so uplifting as the owering of love, nothing so devastating as its loss. A deeply archetypal experience, love is the force that runs our lives. Driven by the forces of love, the fragments of the world seek each other so that the world may come into being. PIERRE TEILHARD DE CHARDIN We cannot live without it, yet the world is crying for lack of it. All forms of child abuse are, in fact, travesties of love. They are travesties because they are not a complete absence of love, but an absence of healthy love. How many children have been spanked and abused, sexually molested, punished severely, smothered, or overmanaged while being told, “This is because I love you so much.” Travesties of love occur when the most needed element of life is twisted and torn, withheld and used as a means of control. Without knowing what healthy love looks like, we have a hard time creating it in our lives. We hang on to mere shreds of love, sacri ce ourselves on its altar, run in fear when we nd it. Instead, we are turning toward the opposite of love: warfare and violence. Television violence models behavior for our children and gangs provide many of our youth with their only sense of belonging. Adolescents in my practice tell me that “cruel is cool,” and to be a man you have to be mean. On a single day in America, 270,000 children carry guns to school and guns are now surpassing automobiles as the number one killer.1 Is this not a travesty of love? Political agendas cut funds for the downtrodden and needy, the immigrants and children, while the defense budget soars. It is alarming enough that our political leaders embody this value system —more alarming still to contemplate the number of people who support them. What kind of cultural mythos is driving such values? Myths are the cultural stories of our origins and our purpose. Unconsciously, these stories in uence and may even rule our lives. They de ne what is possible, shape who we are, and lead us to what can be. Myths are a statement of the primal relationships that exist between archetypal elements in the universe and their counterparts in our own psyches. In the prevailing mythos, we are children of divorce. The Great Mother, a fundamental archetype of the psyche, was worshipped as a living deity for at least 25,000 years during the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods of human history. 2 She is archetypal ancestress to us all, her memory buried deeply in the collective unconscious. She mirrors our early childhood experience of our own mothers and embodies the archetypal imprint of the mothering source— nurturance, nourishment, containment, and connection. In the collective mind of Western civilization, she has long been forgotten. Removed from our predominant mythology, she is conspicuous in her absence. She is only beginning to resurface through the growing Goddess movement, recent archeological research, and the popularity of Jungian archetypal psychology. She is the Mother we have lost and are only just beginning to nd again. She is the archetypal feminine at the primal origin of our cultural history. In her absence, the Great Father has become the sole protagonist in our dominant mythology. He is strong and powerful, but distant and ethereal. He is without a wife or daughter and is estranged from all that the feminine archetype represents. His immediate son has been cruci ed, ostensibly for the sins of the children. In the divorce settlement, we are the motherless children who were taken to live with the Father. In our new household, Mother was not be discussed and became forgotten. We have inherited the myth of a broken home. We are the motherless children in our distant father’s house, trying to nd wholeness in a world that is longing for the magic and mystery of love. This is our story. These are our parents. We are the children of an unacknowledged marriage. No wonder we have such a yearning for romantic love. No wonder the myth of man-meets-woman-and-lives-happily-ever-after pervades our collective fantasies, rendering other forms of love unrecognizable. If we were children of an intact and loving mythical home, a partnership mythology, we might seek union from an experience of cooperation, rather than through a compulsive need to complete our diminished selves through another. Our predominant myth is one of separation. We see ourselves as separate from Nature, separate from each other, and separate from the divine. Separations are created by race, class, gender, and age. Individuals are endowed with the moral right, even encouragement, to do whatever is necessary to further their own individual existence. The environment and its coinhabitants are sacri ced for individual needs. Wealth and class create more separation, more privacy, and more individualism. We have created vast separation between men and women, and further separation between women and women, and between men and men. Love, as the all-pervasive glue of the universe, is culturally restricted to the bonds of limited heterosexual dyads and their often lonely o spring. The model is obviously awed, for our children are abused and our marriages repeat the pattern of our mythical parents —with epidemic divorce. Collectively, it seems we are falling out of love with the world. We all know what deep pain we feel when we fall out of love. It pierces the very core of our being, carves a deep hole in the soul, and wounds and cripples the living spirit. In our disconnection, we can barely relate to all the tragedies occurring in the world. Is it because the very art of relating is becoming a lost art? Is this because the time it takes to relate deeply, feel fully, and communicate and understand is no longer valued as time well spent? We are becoming alienated, hostile, defensive, self-centered, and compulsively consuming. The result is isolation, constriction, and limitation. The ground that holds us becomes shaky, and the energy that evolves us is restricted to traditional patterns that support the myth of separation. In our isolation, we are lost from our spiritual core, lost from the heart. To cross the Rainbow Bridge connecting Heaven and Earth is to consciously reconnect severed parts of the world. It is to anchor the myth of individualism in the necessary grounding of self, while simultaneously expanding that self into a conscious unity with the world around us—socially, ecologically, and mythically. To access the divine and become as gods, we need to recognize our own divine nature as part of the greater mystery of unfolding. To heal  the heart is to reunite mind and body, the mystical and mundane, self and other into an integrated whole. This is our task in the heart chakra as it is the task for every one of us that wants to heal this world and assure its future. Without love, there is no binding force to hold our world together. Without love, there is no integration but instead dis-integration. Without love, our Rainbow Bridge collapses in the middle and we fall into the chasm of separation below.

RAINER MARIA RILKE Riding on the golden ames of our power center, we now arrive at the very heart of the chakra system. Here, in a band of green, lies the center of the Rainbow Bridge, the midpoint of our journey. Like the green, growing plants, which push toward the heavens from their roots in the earth, we, too, reach outward in two directions— anchoring the manifesting current deep in our bodies and expanding the liberating current as we reach beyond ourselves. In the heart chakra, these currents come to perfect balance in the center of our being. From that sacred center—the heart of the system—we enter the mystery of love. The basic issues that we encounter in the heart chakra deal with balance, love, and relationship. Through balance we nd a center from which we can love, through love we form relationships, and through relationships we have the opportunity to transform the self-centered ego of the lower chakras into awareness of the larger realm in which we are embedded. It is the enchantment of love that opens the road to wider consciousness. When we fall in love, we are suddenly stripped of our defenses, lifted out of our self-centered habits, and propelled into an enlarged view of the world. Love melts our rigid attitudes and alters our psychic structure. When we fall in love, we see things anew— colors are enhanced, places take on new meaning, interests of the beloved become interests of our own. In real love, you want the other person’s good. In romantic love, you want the other person. At the same time that love expands our horizons, it also brings us into a deeper connection with ourselves. Falling in love takes us down into our bodies; desire puts us in touch with the physical self through our wants and needs. With another, we celebrate the temple of the body and honor our physicality. As we reach down inside to share our gifts with our beloved, we are forced to confront and develop our deepest nature. The intimacy of love both reveals and integrates the shadow. Loving acceptance of another allows the rejected parts of our psyche to emerge safely. Not only do relationships provide a context in which the shadow is bound to emerge, intimacy invites us to share those deepest, hidden parts of ourselves. In the accepting arms of our beloved, these parts can come to consciousness. This acceptance sets the ground for the self-expression of chakra ve, as only through self-acceptance can we come fully into our truth and have the courage to express it. Intimacy is the foundation for that expression. Being loved by another increases our experience of Self, as we are re ected in the eyes, words, and behavior of our lover. Suddenly we catch a glimpse of our own divinity, our specialness, and begin in a new way to truly care for ourselves and feel a sense of pride and purpose. We take better care of our bodies, keep our houses cleaner, and dare to reach further than we might otherwise. Love brings a spiritual awakening, and the loss of it produces profound despair. Sometimes that loss severs us from our sense of divinity—a state that can hardly be tolerated after the expansion and heightened awareness that love has brought. When love does wane, we are thrown back to our past. The loss brings us to an infantile state of vulnerability, where our needs and issues, patterns and processes are brought to light once again. We are forced to confront and heal our pain in order to go on, to delve into our childhood and psychic structure to unravel the mystery that is Self. As Jung has said, “Love is the dynamism that most infallibly brings the unconscious to light.” 3 Both the presence and the loss of love force us to examine ourselves in a new light.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}

This represents the downward movement of spirit into matter and the upward liberation of matter into spirit, meeting in perfect balance in the heart. More than just a meeting, this is an interpenetration whose nal goal is integration of spirit and mind with body and soul.  Balance is the underlying foundation of longevity in all things.  Since the heart chakra is the middle point in a system of seven centers, balance is an essential principle at this level of integration.  This implies both internal balance between various aspects of ourselves (mind and body, persona and shadow, male and female), as well as balance between ourselves and the world around us (work and play, giving and receiving, socializing and being alone). Finding this equilibrium supports the basic issues of love and relationship,      for without balance within ourselves it is di cult, if not impossible, to achieve healthy and long-lasting love relationships.

OSCAR WILDE  Intimacy, as Thomas Moore so aptly points out, is about bringing forth deeply interior aspects of the self. 4 In order to have intimacy we rst need to have a sense of self. We need to be intimate with our own interior, to know our needs, wishes, fears, boundaries, and hopes. Through knowing the self within, we can honor the self that lives within another. We need to be able to love our own self enough to o er it openly to someone else. Without self-love, this cannot happen.  The most common block in the heart chakra is the absence of self-love. How can we have intimacy with others if we are distanced from our own self? How can we reach out to others when we are  drowning in shame and criticism? How can we maintain balance between ourselves and others if we have no balance within? How can we treat another with respect if we treat our own selves abusively?  Ideally, the demon of shame has been transformed in the third chakra, leaving us ready to enter the heart with an honest regard for the sacredness of our being. To love ourselves is to act respectfully and responsibly toward ourselves, to enjoy our own company when in solitude, to honor our limits and speak our truths. In general, self-love is an act of treating ourselves the way we would treat anyone else that we love—respectfully, honestly, compassionately, with feeling and understanding, pride and patience.  Our relationships with others re ect our relationship with ourselves. We will nd others who treat us the way we expect to be treated, others who respond to the relationship program we carry inside our heart chakra.

They come to see me because they hurt, because their lives are not going well, or because they do not like themselves. That would seem to indicate an awareness of Self, would it not? But when I have a client stand on her feet, do some simple grounding, and look at me and say “I,”  there is too often a hollow ring to the word. Sometimes it’s almost a question, sometimes it’s mechanical, sometimes it’s barely a whisper. Sometimes she cannot meet my eyes and say “I” at the same time. When I ask such clients to expand the statement to “I am in here” (referring to the body), it often becomes apparent that the statement is not true. Either the “I” has not truly been established, or it does not live fully in the body.  Being a friend to yourself is no mere metaphor or purely sentimental idea. It is the basis of all relationship, because it is  a fundamental recognition of soul.  THOMAS MOORE  Yet, such a person may tell me long details about how she feels, what she is doing with her life, or what problems plague her. The ego self is de nitely operating. What is missing?  The beholding of Self is missing. Beholding establishes a sacred relationship. When a teenage daughter comes downstairs for her rst prom date, dressed as a woman for the rst time, we simply behold her. It is an embrace, but it is not physical. To behold is not to x, change, judge, or even want. It is simply to witness—to embrace with our awareness. In beholding the self, we witness a miraculous manifestation of divine energy living right inside us, with all its hopes and fears, joys and tears. This witnessing is “the heart of the heart.” It brings us to the sacred. It is the essential realization that must be present for any real healing to occur.  It has been said that an unexamined life is not worth living. To enter the heart is to enter into self-re ective consciousness, a place of self-examination. In that re ection, we not only de ne ourselves (as in the third chakra) but come into relationship with ourselves.  Self-re ective consciousness is the process of beholding. In therapy, we stop and look at ourselves—at our motives, actions, goals, hopes, and fears. While there are many who are cynical about this process, some kind of systematic self-examination is essential if we are to evolve and if we are going to rise from the power-hungry obsession of the damaged third chakra into a state of integration and peace characteristic of the fourth. Self-re ective consciousness allows us to integrate our psychic pieces, bring them into relationship, and see how they relate to each other and become whole.  It requires conscious attention to change patterns, to create something new, in short, to evolve. Without examining what has been, we are destined to repeat it. Without cultivating consciousness, our ascending current has to turn around and go back down to the base before it has reached its full expansion. In so  doing, we are caught in repetitive loops, neurotic patterns that we repeat again and again.  Self-examination gives birth to a new integrated Self. This Self is no longer bound by the past, but energized by the will beneath it and headed toward the future. Self-examination is essential for establishing the balance that is the central principle of the heart chakra.  Through self-examination we give birth to the conscious being.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}

STANLEY KELEMAN  One of the prime areas of balance in the heart chakra is between mind and body. This occurs through learning to decipher the body’s messages. This involves distinct inner listening on the part of the mind to the body’s subtle communications and often leads to recovering memories, working through traumas, releasing stored tensions, and completing unresolved emotional transactions.  Through this process various parts of our experience are reconnected. Feelings are reconnected with mental images. Impulses are integrated with belief systems. Sensation is connected with meaning. This is the work of self-re ection—allowing the mind to behold our experience in the body.

{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: ANIMA AND ANIMUS   In our second chakra recovery work we encountered (and hopefully integrated) our shadow, which contains the unconscious, rejected  aspects of our personality. With an integrated shadow, we freed up energy previously used to hold the shadow back, and this newfound energy helped move us to chakra three, where we began the process of individuation. In the heart chakra, we continue our individuation by developing another essential balance—that of the inner female and male, or in Jungian terms, anima and animus.  The mystery of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances. If there is any reaction, both are transformed.  C. G. JUNG  The anima is the archetypal energy of the inner feminine, and the animus, the inner masculine. The anima is believed to gure more prominently in men, while the animus is the counterpart in women.  Still, both genders carry each archetype.  These archetypes also exist externally as symbols in the collective consciousness, where they often become stereotypes. A stereotype is a contemporary version of an archetype, such as the docile female or the strong, silent man. Stereotypes are culturally determined versions of the original archetype—often truncated images that emphasize only a part of the archetype behind them.  Our rst imprinting of these archetypes came from our mother and father, yet their behavior was in uenced by the stereotypes of their time. Other stereotypes are fed to us through movies and romance novels, advertising and television, then reinforced by social pressure from peers.  It is important to realize that the images of masculine and feminine that we ascribe to anima and animus are culturally dictated, rather than innate. If our images of masculine and feminine become strongly polarized—meaning that masculine is de ned by absence of the feminine and vice versa—then it is likely  that either our anima or animus will be repressed. We have no permission for the opposite within ourselves to emerge.  Charles, for example, has accepted the prevailing cultural attitudes about what a man should be. He thinks a man should be strong, rational, tough, independent, successful, cool, and unemotional. To Charles, any display of vulnerability, emotion, uncertainty, or softness threatens his self-image. Since his image is so polarized, his inner feminine cannot come out at all. His anima may appear as fearful images in dreams, as depression or moodiness. It remains repressed, to be unconsciously projected onto his girlfriend. She is supposed to carry the anima for him by doing the feeling and supporting work, and maintaining the emotional quality of the relationship.  Like the shadow, the unconscious anima or animus gets projected onto others, often in idealized states, wreaking havoc on our intimate relationships. If a man has rejected his own feminine nature, he may abhor the feminine in other men while expecting his female partner to completely carry his concept of the feminine, criticizing any independent, assertive behavior she might display.  Similarly, a woman who has not developed her masculine side expects her man to be awlessly powerful, accomplished, and heroic, while she is simultaneously oppressed by these qualities.  Women who claim they want a nice guy and then reject him when he shows feelings or softness are projecting their animus. If they can allow their own masculine side to increase, they can allow their men to become more gentle. If we nd in our relationships that what initially attracts us later repels us, we might do well to look for projected anima or animus.  In both heterosexual and gay relationships, the archetypes can be reversed. A woman, gay or straight, may well live the masculine life and repress her own feminine. A man may carry the feminine in his relationship with either a woman or a man. The anima and animus are more related to the concept of opposites in the developed self than actual gender. The point is to recognize and bring forth the side that is undeveloped. The hard-edged career woman may need  to develop her softer side, while the introverted, supportive male may need to develop his initiating, masculine side.  The resolution of the anima and animus represents the internal sacred marriage, or hieros gamos, the balancing of masculine and feminine energies within. This alchemical marriage, as Jung described it, is another step in the individuation process that leads toward wholeness. Only when this process occurs within can we hope to be free from dependence and projection and to enter cleanly and freely into relationship with another.  The hieros gamos stage in the individuation process usually occurs during midlife. In the earlier development of our personality, we often favor one side over the other. The scientist may have developed a noteworthy career that sacri ced home life. He may adhere to a logic and exactitude that dominates feeling and imagination, or have an extroverted personality that is constantly engaged with others through his work. At midlife, he may nd himself in a crisis that calls forth his repressed feminine side. He may lose his wife, who has carried the feminine archetype for him, and be faced with his inability to supply himself with the simple arts of cooking or creating a pleasurable home environment. He may nd himself unable to interpret his feelings, dried up in his creativity, exhausted from too much yang and not enough yin, or unable to spend time alone.  The woman who has given body and soul to her marriage and family may nd at midlife that she has never lived for herself. She may have always followed in another’s footsteps and kept her feelings within, harmoniously blending with the needs of others around her without regard for her own destiny. She has carried the archetypal feminine sel essly, but she may feel helpless and lost when it comes to striking out on her own when the children leave home and no longer de ne her as mother. Her husband, who has worked hard in the world to provide for her needs, may be shocked when she wants to leave him, but her need to develop her own animus may be impossible within the rigid context of her marriage.  She now must learn to carry both archetypes within herself.  Though we may wish it were possible, no one else can live our unlived lives for us. Our partners never do it right and we soon nd ourselves criticizing them and complaining. “If only you’d do this; if only you didn’t do that.” If the masculine and feminine archetypes are repressed within us, their qualities will seem very mysterious or even undesirable. We are challenged to reclaim them rather than look once again for someone to live them for us while we remain incomplete. When the anima and animus have been equally developed, our relationships have stability, mutual respect, and freedom.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}

PIERRE TEILHARD DE CHARDIN  Nowhere is the concept of balance more important than in the success of our personal relationships. If there is a recurrent cry from couples struggling through the labyrinth of con icted relationship, it is that they lack balance with their signi cant other. One partner is too distant while another feels su ocated. One partner does too much housework while the other is resentful about unequal nancial earnings. One partner wants sex more than the other, initiates all the communication, or does all the emotional work.  Take a moment to consider what is out of balance in your own relationship.  Nature seeks balance. Lack of balance is experienced as pressure, frustration, and stress, leading to resentment and an erosion of  openness and goodwill. If the relationship cannot eventually nd an equitable balance, it is doomed to failure either through termination or resigned misery.

{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: REACHING OUT AND TAKING IN   As the third chakra involves mastering the energetic principles of holding on and letting go, the fourth chakra works with reaching out and taking in. Fear and grief block either or both of these responses, and can eventually block the heart chakra itself. If the heart chakra is blocked, then the arms will be blocked as well. They may habitually fold over the chest, be bound at the sides, or move awkwardly and self-consciously. If the chest is full or in ated, there may be a refusal to reach out, a fear of surrender, perhaps even a bit of narcissism, or the holding up of the Challenger-Defender structure (see this page, Challenger-Defender Character). If the arms are weak and move aimlessly and the chest is collapsed (as in the Oral structure), then it indicates an inability to take in and nourish oneself. Reaching may have become blocked because it proved fruitless in the past.  The ideal situation for really understanding another is not so much how a person reacts to extreme stress, but rather how he or she su ers the vulnerability of falling in love.  ALDO CARATENUTO  It is easier for the child to stop reaching altogether than to reach and nd emptiness. In this scenario, however, the energetic  structure of the chakra gets built around that emptiness. They reach out to give, but cannot receive. The chakra is de cient.  More often, one movement will be more prevalent than the other.  I often ask couples to close their eyes and express through body language the predominant energetic process of their relationship.  After they have taken their positions, I ask them to open their eyes and see what each is doing. Often one will be leaning forward, arms outstretched, while the other is leaning slightly backward, with arms folded or palms facing their partner as if to hold them back.  With wordless wisdom, this indicates the dynamics of the relationship.  When David and Julie did this exercise, it was clear that Julie did the reaching and David pulled back. His arms folded neatly over his chest; he stood rmly and proudly in his ground, while Julie beckoned openly to him. David’s own mother had been deceptively sweet, smothering him with a love that masked her own needs. As a result, he had become mistrustful and defensive in his heart chakra.  He was unable to take in the love Julie was o ering, mistrusting her intentions. I asked him to open his arms and Julie to drop hers by her side, so they could experience the possibility of a di erent dynamic with di erent feelings. David felt relieved of the burden of having to defend. Julie could feel that it was possible to receive without demanding. This is the age-old dance of the pursuer and the distancer. When the pursuer stops chasing, the distancer can reach out.  For Kathy it was a matter of changing old patterns. Kathy had been nursing a broken heart from a former relationship with months of deep grieving. As springtime approached, she began a new relationship with another woman in which she was nding a profound sweetness. Yet along with the excitement of falling in love again, she was also gripped with fear. “My last two relationships ended abominably. How do I know this won’t happen again? I’m terri ed!”  I asked her to focus on the sweetness she had been describing in her new relationship and feel what happened in her body as she did so. “I feel like swooning. I get dizzy and light. It’s the falling of  falling in love.” I asked her to stand and let her body express this feeling of swooning and show what it looked like, while another group member stood in for her lover. Suddenly, she was no longer in her own ground but falling toward the other woman, out of balance and out of control. She had left her own center. No wonder she was terri ed!  Her concept of love was based on moving toward the other person, with a focus on the surrendering and reaching out. While this is an essential element in any relationship, it was clear that she was missing the concept of her lover moving toward her. She tried to assure herself that the other person was trustworthy (something we can never fully depend upon) so she could let go and surrender. But that very act of surrender was an abandonment of her own self and a recipe for eventual disaster. I had her practice pulling her lover in toward herself while holding her own ground.

{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: ATTACHMENT AND FREEDOM   Thomas Moore, in his book Soul Mates, talks about the struggle between the soul’s need for attachment and the spirit’s need for freedom. This struggle is a major theme in most relationships, enacted through the simultaneous longing and fear of commitment.  In the heart chakra, we seek to balance the lower chakras’ pull for security with the upper chakras’ pull toward novelty. When our partner constricts us, we get restless and want to push away. The spirit hates constriction and limitation, hates to be squashed.  Attachment and freedom is the way we experience the universal forces in their holding on and letting go.  The soul, however, nds security in the body, in familiarity and permanence. The soul likes a container, which allows the energy to build, whereas the spirit might resent it. When our partner is pulling away, the soul becomes insecure and wants to hold on. When our partner clings, the spirit feels restless and con ned. A healthy relationship needs to honor both the upward and downward movements of energy and create a balance between spirit and soul, expansion and constriction, freedom and commitment.  Moore states it plainly: “Many people seem to live the pain of togetherness and fantasize the joys of separateness; or, vice versa, they live a life of solitude and ll their heads with alluring images of intimacy. Bouncing back and forth between these two valid claims on the heart can be a frustrating, endless struggle that never  bears fruit and never settles down.”5  To decide upon one or the other is to further the divorce between the transcendence of the Father and the immanence of the Mother.  As children of divorce, we search for refuge in one or the other, ignorant of the dynamic balance that serves both liberation and manifestation.  The more we allow one kind of energy, the more the other can come through. Once a commitment is made, it is easier to allow a partner their solitude or freedom. Once we know our freedom is respected, we can more easily make a commitment. Conversely, the more a partner insists on one aspect, the more his lover will yearn for its opposite.

{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: EROS AND THANATOS   One of the hardest dynamics to accept in the realm of love and relationships is the dance between Eros, the force of life that allures and unites, and Thanatos, the force of death that divides and destroys. Eros is the son of Aphrodite, shining goddess of love and beauty, while Thanatos, born of the goddess Night, thrives on the darkness of our lack of consciousness.  When we enter into a relationship, we are joyfully swept up in the wings of Eros. We are called forth, beckoned into union, into merging and dissolving. Reaching beyond ourselves, beyond our own small ego, we touch something greater, wider, deeper. We are thrilled and expanded. This is what we long for, what we aspire to, what makes living worthwhile.  To love means to open ourselves to the negative as well as the positive—to grief, sorrow, and disappointment as well as to joy, ful llment and an intensity of consciousness we did not know was possible before.  ROLLO MAY  It is that which hides in the darkness of the unconscious that brings death to love. Our unconscious patterns sabotage relationships, pick ghts, distance ourselves from our lover, and thrust our behavior in directions the conscious mind deplores. Our partner’s lack of consciousness annoys us, and makes us want to pull away. Our own failed awareness misses those cues to our partner’s needs, and we wake up one morning to the sight of our beloved standing with bags packed, saying, “It’s over.” It is then that we stare squarely in the face of Thanatos. Like Eros, Thanatos is a force we cannot control, one that leaves us feeling helpless.  It is not possible to have Eros without Thanatos. This does not mean that all relationships must end in tragedy, but that coming together and pulling apart are two inseparable steps in a single dance. For those who want only the coming together, Thanatos becomes extreme in his insistence. For those who honor the separation, the distancing, the misunderstandings, and estrangements as part of the ow and growth of relationships, the dance of Eros can be eternally renewed.  Those who are most idealistic about love sometimes nd the greatest pain. Wide-eyed they fall, giving their utmost to the beloved. Great is their dismay, when, giving all they could and valuing this love above all things, they see their lover casually mistreat what they had regarded as sacred. Denial of Thanatos invites his more unpleasant form to appear.  We can avoid the painful side of Thanatos if we remember to honor his presence. We must be aware of what lurks in the darkness of our unacknowledged shadow. We need to claim, not deny, our need for a certain amount of separateness, our fear of engulfment, and understand that the same fear in our partner is not a statement about us, but Thanatos’s need to balance the relationship so Eros can continue the dance of love and attraction.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE  When Thanatos strikes, as it inevitably does, we experience grief. As the resident demon, grief sits on the heart chakra like a stone. When our heart is heavy with grief, it’s hard to open, even hard to breathe. When grief is denied, we become numb to our feelings and our aliveness. We become hard and cold, rigid and distant. We may feel dead inside. When grief is acknowledged and expressed, however, we nd a vital key to opening the heart. Tears are shed, truth expressed, and the heart lightens. The breath deepens. There is a sense of spaciousness that emerges, allowing more room inside for our spirit. Hope is reborn. Coming to terms with our own grief leads us toward compassion for others.  When we fall in love, we strip ourselves of defenses. We open to another and to the world. We expand and grow. When we are hurt in matters of love, we are hurt in our most vulnerable, trusting aspects. The purest form of self is wounded. It no longer seems safe to be authentic. Our system—wounded at the very core—shuts down and we lose not only our lover but ourselves as well. This is the deepest loss.  One of my clients called while I was working on this chapter. Her voice on the phone was shaky and tearful. “I know it’s over, I just know it. He’s going to leave me.” I remembered that she had said this two weeks ago when I last saw her, and again two weeks before that.  “You mean it’s still going?” I asked.  “Yes, and he even wants to come to therapy with me, but I know it’s over. He just doesn’t know how to say it. Why does this always happen to me? I feel so lost right now, like I hate myself. I just want to disappear.”  “Then you’re abandoning yourself,” I say. “It’s not that he has abandoned you, necessarily, but that you have abandoned yourself over the thought of it. So, of course, you’ll think he’ll abandon you, too.”  There was sudden calm on the other end of the phone. “Oh,” she said. “I get it. You know I haven’t eaten yet today, or taken a shower. I’ve just been obsessing about this. What should I do?”  “Go inside to the self that’s scared right now. Promise her you’ll always be there. Fix her a nice lunch. Go take a shower. You can’t control your boyfriend, but you can promise to be there yourself.  That goes a long way.”  When I saw her next it was, indeed, with her boyfriend. He had not left her, nor was he planning to. Instead he was trying to assure her of his ongoing commitment. She appeared less clinging, and we were able to facilitate some valuable communication.  Grief that occurs at the end of a relationship is easy to understand. It puts us back in touch with our primal abandonment, and makes us feel powerless. If acknowledged and expressed, it  eventually passes, but sometimes we carry grief from situations that are not so obvious, as in the case of Susan.  Susan had a mother who loved her too much. She was an only child and her mother had little else to occupy her life besides being Susan’s mother. Susan felt special and was never alone. She lacked for nothing in terms of attention, clothing, or toys. Yet Susan was not allowed her own independence. Her mother was subtly threatened when she played at friends’ houses and later when she began to date. Susan’s de nition of love was shaped by her mother.  When she did form relationships later in life, she was as smothering and possessive as her mother had been. When her partner did not lavish the same amount of attention on her, she felt unloved. While we might assume that Susan would grow up secure and con dent, in actuality, she feared she was not enough and became quite codependent. She could never replace her mother’s real needs for an authentic life, and so she always felt inadequate.  Susan thought she had had a happy childhood. But her chest was constricted and she was frequently depressed. As she learned to breathe more deeply, she contacted a vast reservoir of grief. At rst she did not understand why it was there, but as she continued her grieving process, she recognized through her deeper self that the grief she carried was a mourning for the loss of her own authenticity.  If we consider that love may indeed be the most important element of well-being and spiritual growth, then any impairment in our ability to nd love is a profound wound. When we further consider that this impairment a ects how we treat each other in the larger social sphere, we have not only a personal problem, but a serious collective situation as well.

In the heart  chakra, we now reach beyond ourselves and expand that passion to include an understanding of another’s needs. The ego, when secure in its own autonomy and power, can now surrender willingly toward altruism. If our own needs have been met and satis ed, we can now share our fullness with another.  Great compassion penetrates into the marrow of the bone. It is the support of all living beings. Like the love of a parent for an only child, the tenderness of the Compassionate One is all-pervasive.  NAGARJUNA (INDIAN, FIRST CENTURY)  The ability to have compassion for others depends rst on our ability to be in touch with our yearnings and pain. Pain opens us to deeper understanding of others and expands our own limited being.  Thus compassion is an exquisite balance of upper and lower chakra expression. Compassion remains centered, yet open, and it quietly holds the space for change to occur, providing both the stability of a container and the freedom of release.  Whoever wishes to attain Buddhahood need not follow the various practice but must only practice one thing and that is deep compassion.  CHENREZIG  Compassion does not mean that we have to x things. Most of the time, we can’t, but rather than turn away we can still o er compassion to others. When I work with couples, I often see that  one partner wants compassion while the other feels a demand to make it di erent. “I just want you to realize how hard it is for me to be alone with the kids all day,” she says.  “What do you want me to do, quit my job?” he replies impatiently.  She looks hurt and frustrated, as that is not what she meant. What she wanted was empathy and understanding, not necessarily solutions. She wanted to hear, “I know this is hard for you.

Devotion is an act of sel ess love and conscious surrender to a greater force beyond oneself. In the many branches of yoga, it is the path of bhakti yoga, practiced through devotional service to a deity or teacher, through which one experiences the transcendent joy of merging with the divine. Devotion also occurs toward the beloved, within a family, or to a political cause or project. With devotion we are allowing the energy within the Self to ow beyond the Self. This transcends our perceived limitations. When we become parents, we experience sel ess devotion to the newborn child as we transcend the limits of what we thought was possible in terms of loving and giving.  Devotion is a spiritual act of egoless surrender. When the Self binds the spirit too tightly, then devotion expands the binding by lifting us beyond ourselves. We get the powerful lesson that the Self survives even without constant attention.  Devotion can also keep us from conscious connection with the Self, especially if the ego-based stage of re ective consciousness has  not already been achieved. We may nd it easier to be directed by the will of another than to work through the labyrinth of our own inner yearnings. In this case, devotion depletes the ego-centered third chakra for the purpose of an excessive outpouring in the fourth. If the object of our worship should leave, fall from grace, or reject us, we are devastated. To heal, we must then reconnect responsibly to the self within, seeing it as an aspect of divinity in its own right, and much in need of love and understanding.

KEN WILBER  When Alex was about ve, he came down with a stomach u that kept him in bed for a few days. As he was sick to his stomach, I was not about to force him to eat, but wanted him to have nourishment if he wanted it. So I prepared some toast, left it on a plate next to his bed, and tucked him in with his teddy bear. He soon recovered and the incident was forgotten. A few weeks later, when I was taking an afternoon nap, I woke to nd a plate of awkwardly buttered toast placed on my night table and a teddy bear on the pillow next to me. This was a true sign he was in the heart chakra stage.  The fourth chakra developmental stage begins when the child moves from the intense egocentricity and willfulness of the third chakra into a readiness to meet and cooperate with others. This generally begins between three and four years, after autonomy and basic impulse control have been established. It may happen suddenly, when the seemingly impossible child spontaneously does something sweet and kind for someone else. A child may also swing back to stubborn willfulness at three-and-a-half before nally moving on to the more loving and harmonious heart chakra stage at around four years. In the uncertainty of new behavior, a child often  runs back to familiar patterns for security. Development is not always smooth.  As we climb further up the chakras, the exact timing of the developmental stages becomes less speci c. It depends in part on the successful resolution of previous stages, which varies from case to case, and the variations widen as we get higher. Unfortunately, many people do not reach the upper chakra stages at all, or do so only later in life. Therefore, we will now begin to discuss both childhood and adult development.  In childhood, fourth chakra development marks the formation of our social identity, also known as the persona. This is the aspect of self that we create to win love, gain social approval, and get along in the larger world. In the fourth chakra we no longer see the world entirely in terms of our own needs, and so our relationships expand from being speci cally one-on-one (i.e., child and mother, child and father) to include larger family and social structures. The child now nds that she is part of Mommy and Daddy’s relationship with each other, and that she has brothers and sisters, classmates, neighbors, and friends of her own.  The verbal messages that were internalized during the third chakra stage centered around action and behavior. Now in the fourth chakra stage it is the parent-child relationship itself that becomes internalized. It is not only the messages Dad continually gives us about being noisy in the house, but also the context of Dad’s relationship with us that becomes important. If the message was given in the context of fear, we feel fear along with the internalized message. How we behave and who we become is shaped by the way we internalize our basic family relationships.  Eric Berne outlined these internal relationships in his theories of transactional analysis, which describes how we operate from internalized parent, adult, or child scripts. If we rebel against Dad’s messages, we are playing the script of the naughty child with a critical parent, and aspects of it become part of our internal dialogue. Throughout life, we may nd both roles simultaneously clamoring for the driver’s seat, as sometimes we will be led by rebellious urges, while at others we will be held back by our inner  critic. We also repeat these relationships with others. If a friend criticizes you, they may suddenly become your critical parent. Then you nd yourself reacting like a naughty child, instead of listening to what they have to say.  Children internalize relationships by imitation. A child who is frequently scolded may be overheard scolding her doll or best friend. Alex was imitating his mother when he brought me the toast.  This imitation is called identi cation, and forms the core of the relationship program. Identi cation is where the child adopts the beliefs, attitudes, values, and behaviors of others, and then carries these attitudes into her relationships.  As gender roles get internalized, we develop our gender identi cation. Watching how parents, brothers, or sisters behave gives us our rst models of how to be boys or girls. As we watch our big sister play with dolls or put on makeup, watch our brother play with trains or lizards, watch our mother give herself over to the needs of the family, and see our father relentlessly pursue his career, we are, for better or worse, developing gender-oriented behavior programs.  It is here that we take on gender roles. This is the age where boys are told not to cry and when girls are told to be nice. This splitting and repression of masculine or feminine comes to the fore again in midlife, when our one-sided development leads us into some kind of personal crisis. As stated earlier, heart chakra work includes the reintegration of anima and animus.  The child internalizes not only the relationship he has with his parents but also the entire family system. He may become an eldest child with new siblings, removed from the center of attention he once held. He may realize he is the youngest of many siblings, and learn his social identity from the way his brothers and sisters treat him. Or he may be the middle child that has to compete for attention. These dynamics took a backseat in the “it’s all about me”  stage of the third chakra, but emerge as part of the personality at chakra four. We then play out this family dynamic in the social arenas of school, work, clubs, and the families we form as adults. As the growing child joins the family dynamic, he takes on roles such  as that of the good child, scapegoat, hero, clown, or lost child, to name but a few. These roles are like steps in a dance, unconscious patterns that form our social identities. What may begin as the conscious cultivation of a certain behavior (“Mommy likes it when I make her laugh”) may grow into a lifelong role (playing the clown).  The development of a social identity prepares the child for more complex interaction with the larger world. This requires a delicate balance between maintaining and relinquishing autonomy, which should have developed in the third chakra. For the child whose autonomy is weak, there is a tendency to be swept away by others, be de ned by them, or live in fear of losing the self. A kindergartner may steal someone else’s cookies simply because his friend told him to, not realizing it was not his own urge until he gets in trouble for it. Then he says, “Billy told me to!” A child whose will was overly indulged may be too self-centered and may get rejected by others, such as the school bully who dominates the younger children or the egocentric classmate who always steals the center of attention.  Intellectual development also takes a monumental leap at this stage. We have entered Piaget’s preoperational period where  “intellectual development proceeds in the conceptual-symbolic rather than the earlier sensory-motor arena.” 6 Having mastered the basic building blocks of language, the child now begins the task of assembling the many pieces of his experience. The child is interested in relationships not only between people, but among all the components of the world around him. He is learning to assemble raw information into larger concepts that dictate behavior. Instead of using helpfulness as a way to get a cookie, he realizes that helpfulness is a good concept. He then wants recognition for his intentions as opposed to his act. This is the good boy/nice girl stage of moral development described by Lawrence Kohlberg. The child is creating himself by incorporating new concepts into his growing personality.  Routines are sets of relationships. Children at this age often get upset when standard routines are disrupted—when someone sits at their place at the table, when taking a bath occurs before dinner instead of after, or when stability in the household is disrupted. The  introduction of stepparents, other siblings, new households, or changes in the daily routine of school or day care can be especially disruptive at this stage. Security and identity are derived from stable relationships. When those relationships end or are threatened, as through divorce, death, or separation, then the sense of security and developing social identity can be threatened. The internalized relationship with ourselves is simultaneously a ected. If we lose one of our parents, for example, we do not get to see how the two genders interact with each other, and hence may not have that balance in ourselves. (With some marriages, however, this may be a blessing.)  Finally, this is the age when peer relationships begin developing.  A child enters school, chooses friends, and tries out these behavior programs in the world outside the family. The child learns whether she is well-liked or rejected, and thus her social identity gets added on to her ego identity as a new basis for self-esteem. It is interesting that the most common time for imaginary playmates occurs between ages four and six, as if this were a practice realm for real relationships.  Since relationships are the formative ground for fourth chakra development, it is important to ask some basic questions. Do relationships in the family depend on aggressive ghting for one’s rights? Do they depend on giving up oneself to avoid punishment or rejection? Do they involve the expression of emotions and a ection, or do the parents hide this aspect of their own relationship? Is communication modeled so that the child sees how problems get worked through, or is the rule to not talk about anything di cult?  Does one parent dominate the other, or is there a sense of cooperative partnership? Are brothers and sisters given equal attention or is there favoritism, and, if so, on what is it based? Most of all—is there consistency in relationships? Is Daddy warm and giving on some days and cruelly abusive on others? These are the elements that teach the child how to behave in the world.  Erikson has described this stage as being the struggle of initiative vs. guilt, building on the previous stage of autonomy vs. shame.  Autonomy gives rise to initiative in the form of reaching out toward  others. Shame inhibits this reaching out, and inhibits the awakening of the heart chakra. If the child lacks initiative, she is dependent upon the reactions of others, and will play a passive role in relationships. Successful handling of this stage, according to Erikson, results in direction and purpose.  Socialization is where an individual acquires behavior patterns, motivations, attitudes, and values that the culture deems important.  In our current social structure, this process requires that we deny many aspects of our lower chakras. To be properly socialized, the child needs to learn to control or rise above her spontaneous aggressive urges, dependencies, and fears. For males, this may also include the emotions in general. Thus the social identity often develops at the cost of previous identities. For the child whose social identity is about pleasing others, for example, the cost may be a denial of her own needs. The lost child who hides in the background denies his need for attention. Loss of contact with the original ground creates a kind of existential emptiness that then gets projected onto relationships. We end up looking to others for security, emotional ful llment, or ego enhancement because we have denied these things within ourselves.  Between chakras three and four, the child may get the message that autonomy and love are an either-or phenomenon. This is particularly true when conditional love is used to modify behavior.  Johnny soon learns what behavior pleases Mommy and what aspects of himself meet with rejection. “Mommy ignores me when I cry. She holds me when I’m quiet.” We grow up believing we can either be ourselves or we can be loved, and think it is impossible to have both at once.  The appropriate completion of our social identity results in a transcendence of the ego without undue sacri ce of autonomy. The child can identify with others as equally important as the self and has the ability to cooperate with family, friends, and the larger social environment.  Every functioning adult has reached at least some basic level of ego development. Still, there are many adults who have not yet made a transition to the fourth chakra. They remain stuck in the  narcissistic ego-grati cation of the third chakra even in their close relationships, and have di culty experiencing true empathy and altruism. Crises that appear in midlife (usually through the pain of failed relationships) often reveal wounds from early childhood.  These lower chakra wounds can then be healed, which allows the heart chakra to open. In these cases fourth chakra development may occur in midlife, as we enter the integrative phase of our adult individuation process.  The parts of us that get ignored or outwardly rejected retreat to the realm of the unconscious. They become part of the shadow, split o from the persona. The persona is made of aspects that bring us love, while the shadow, those that seem unacceptable. As adults, part of our fourth chakra work is to reunite the persona with the rejected shadow for the purpose of balance and wholeness.  Adult development of the heart chakra results in a transcendence of the ego, an integration of the higher and lower chakras, creation of the sacred marriage of masculine and feminine, and development of social empathy and altruism. It is the achievement of balance within, as we integrate our many subpersonalities, and the expression of that balance through our relationships with others.  Indeed, the fourth chakra is the gateway to spiritual ful llment and personal mastery. Its reward is self-acceptance and self-love.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: TRAUMAS AND ABUSES   There is nothing more devastating than lack of love. Love is the primal glue of the universe, the binding force par excellence. As the central integrating chamber, the heart chakra is the healer, the uni er. Love integrates and lack of love disintegrates. Without love to bind us together, we separate from the parts of ourselves that drive love away. We reject the needy parts, the angry parts, the ugly parts. Then we are no longer whole.  Thus children … are confronted by a tormenter they love, not one they hate, and this tragic complication will have a devastating in uence on their entire subsequent life.  ALICE MILLER  All abuses traumatize the heart chakra as they betray love. Most of these abuses occur within the context of family relationships. It is bad enough that they happen, but worse still that they happen at the hands of people we love, people we live with, people we need to trust. So we su er not only the abuse, but also a distortion of the relationship in which it occurs. We shut down the connection, close o the heart, and pull back into ourselves.  When primary relationships distort, we diminish our ability to love and connect—to become relational. To be relational means, simply, that we are able to relate or can align our own experiences to a larger context outside. In relating, we connect to things, and see how they are connected to each other. So many of my clients, women in particular, complain about the lack of energy their partners put into their relationships. Their men, they say, act as if they live in a world of their own where the relationship is an afterthought or something they take for granted. These men (and it happens to women, too) see relationships as things rather than as living processes. Their capacity to be relational is underdeveloped.  When relationships are distorted, so is our sense of how things connect. Seeing the bigger picture—the context in which life is embedded—becomes impaired. This prevents us from rising into a larger sense of our own being.  A young child is an open, unarmored being who is completely dependent on his caretakers. In this state, the child is an uninhibited channel of love for those who care for him. His rst understanding of love comes from the ful llment of his survival and dependency needs—that he is cared for, attended to, and safe. When he is mirrored and nurtured, and when his autonomy is supported, he is  also being loved. If all has gone well, a good foundation for dependent love has been built by the time the child reaches the fourth chakra stage. They perceive the parents as the ones to whom they relate for their personal needs and who help them understand the complex world around them.  It is literally heartbreaking when the trust and love that a child has for his caretakers is used against him. In adult relationships, we have the choice (perceived or not) to get up and leave when someone mistreats us; a child does not have this choice. A child does not even have the choice not to love.  The e ects of this mistreatment occur simultaneously on three levels:  1. The experience of the abuse, which may create traumas that distort the natural development of the body and psyche in any of the chakras.  2. The interpretation of the abuse, which is usually attributed to our own shortcomings, as opposed to those of our parents.  3. The fusion of the abuse with love, where the two become related to each other, inseparably linked. This link perpetuates abuse in adult relationships.  If a child is attended to super cially but not touched or given speci c attention, then his love for others will be equally super cial.  He su ers physically from the lack of touch; emotionally, from feelings of shame; and conceptually, from a distorted concept of love. If a father sexually abuses his daughter who loves and trusts him, he is teaching her a distorted form of relating where there is no respect for boundaries. Adult survivors of such abuse often feel disembodied, have poor boundaries in their love relationships, and may de ne their worth in sexual terms. If a child is ignored or shamed by the very people who are most important in her life, then she internalizes that distortion in his relationship to herself. Her own internal voice will carry that criticism, and keep her in a state of utter worthlessness. In relationships with others, she will nd people who will corroborate that worthlessness and perpetuate the cycle.  Any form of abuse impacts these three levels: the developmental process, our self-esteem, and relationship to others. Each of these levels will be discussed in more detail below.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}

JOHN BRADSHAW  I worked with a woman who had been adopted by an aunt after her parents were suddenly killed in World War II. Her aunt constantly compared her to her natural children. “Why don’t you do as well in school as your sister? You must be stupid! Why are you so lazy compared to your brother? What’s wrong with you?” Even though she was cared for super cially, the original trauma of losing her parents was never addressed, leaving her at a disadvantage. There was no time to heal or repair developmental gaps before moving on to later stages. Of course, she could not compete with siblings who had not had such traumas.  Abuse is the antithesis of love. If we do not get the love we need, we lack the basic ingredient necessary to assemble ourselves. Abuse of any kind undermines the natural developmental process as it interferes with the internal wiring of the physical, emotional, and psychic system. If this happened in our stereo, we would have irregular volume control, distorted sound quality, or static interference. When it happens in the psyche, we feel like defective merchandise—our ne-tuning is out of kilter.  Abuse interferes with our love of life. If life hurts, or is lonely, rejecting, empty, hostile, or dangerous, then we do not want to relate to it. Life becomes a painful experience, a process to be endured.

Our relationship to our mother comes to represent more than how we feel about Mom, it a ects how we understand the archetypal symbol of Mother as well as the feminine in general. If our mother mistreated us, our internal relationship to the feminine and all it represents will be impaired. If she withheld these qualities, we will expect them to be withheld everywhere, even by men. If she used them as a means for control, we will fear being controlled by our need for them. As we project this impairment on the women we meet in life, we nd that we are relating more to our damaged  internal image of the feminine than to the actual women we meet.  Our anger, expectations, defenses, and needs all get woven into the relationship and may get tangled with our partner’s internal framework, which may also be just as damaged. This is grounds for a mess indeed! Then we have two people relating from their wounds and defenses, rather than from their wholeness. They see their own projections, rather than each other. Unfortunately, this is frequently par for the course.  All acts of abuse occur within the context of relationship.  Relationship thus becomes the eld in which all events are interpreted, and the ground in which they are later internalized.  The way our father treated us a ects our relationship with all men as well as our internal masculine.

As she had rejected her mother’s feelings, she also denied her own feelings. In compensation for that denial she turned to alcohol. When she nally dealt with her alcoholism, she was forced to confront both her unmet needs as a child and the way her image of her father had masked her feelings of abandonment.  Harville Hendrix, in his best-selling book Getting the Love You Want, calls the internalized relationship with our mother or father an imago. The imago is a “composite picture of the people who have  in uenced you most strongly at an early age.” 8 This image is not formed in the conscious mind but is like a template etched into the nervous system over years of constant interaction with our family. It programs our reactions, defenses, behaviors, and interpretations of events. It becomes part of our character armor, part of our personality.  Our relationship to internalized archetypal forces de nes our relationship to the world. Whether we approach the world from a place of responsibility or rebellion, from expecting acceptance or rejection, all this remains part of our relationship program. The initial imprint shaping this program is the family. Only by unraveling these primary relationships can we hope to nd the self-re ective consciousness necessary to break the habitual patterns and create new and productive relationships.  Our current relationships always provide the training ground for this process. They put us on the cutting edge of our growth, for who but our intimate partner knows best our hopes and fears, strengths and weaknesses? Who but our partner bears the brunt of our expectations and angers, our projections and manipulations? Who but our partner is the best mirror for our growth?  The heart chakra is about bonding. Unintegrated parts of ourselves that are not bonded into the heart with love will seek bonding elsewhere. Our shamed little child may bond with our partner’s critical parent, and constantly recreate a dynamic that keeps us feeling worthless. Our rejected anger may seek someone who carries a temper, giving us ample opportunities to reclaim this lost piece of ourselves. Our various selves seek bonds that are permanent.  Unfortunately, bonding patterns are not always fun. We can become trapped in them, oppressed by them. We lose the freshness of seeing our partner as who they really are, and instead see only the critical parent, needy child, or rejecting aspect of their personality. The only way to break these patterns is to become conscious of these relationships within ourselves—to listen, discover, and honor the many aspects of our inner complexity.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: TWISTED CONCEPTS OF LOVE  Con icted relationships skew our conception of love. Since the child is so dependent, there is no room in the child’s mind for the contradiction between love and abuse. To keep their world consistent, children deny the e ects of abuse or convince themselves that they deserve it. Even acts of cruelty are seen as acts of love.  When a child is being spanked and told, “This hurts me as much as it hurts you. I’m only doing it because I love you,” the child is given a very strange message about what love is. They equate love with pain and with mistreatment. As recipients of that love, it becomes their duty to bear the pain and not question it. Alice Miller, in her aptly named book For Your Own Good, describes pointedly: “When what was done to me was done for my own good, then I am expected to accept this treatment as an essential part of life and not question it.” 9 This acceptance impacts the heart chakra, as well as the upper three chakras, a ecting our ability to speak our truth, to see clearly, and to question in general.  The love a child has for his or her parents ensures that their conscious or unconscious acts of mental cruelty will go undetected.  ALICE MILLER  Later, in adult relationships, we may be blind to abuse from our partner. We do not fully believe we are being mistreated, carrying in our hearts the illusion of being loved. Bradshaw has named this the fantasy bond. It is an illusion that keeps us believing that our partner (father, mother, friend, lover) really does love us—maybe today is just a bad day, we did something wrong, or it will be better tomorrow. We know it will change if only we could do this or did not do that. We make excuses for their behavior, and continue to accept what would normally be unacceptable. As the child has an  incessant need to feel loved at all costs, he fantasizes a love when it is not really there.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: Rejection No section on heart chakra traumas would be complete without a discussion of rejection. A universal experience that wounds us all, rejection is a fear that dwells at the core of the human heart. It brings people into their deepest despair, their darkest fears, and their heaviest grief. Fear of rejection is the prime reason we hold back our love and close down the heart chakra.  At the moment of betrayal a wound is opened in our most vulnerable spot—our original trust—which is that of a totally defenseless infant who cannot survive in the world except in someone’s arms.  ALDO CARATENUTO  When rejection occurs, we often feel helpless. Our self-esteem plummets, our feelings mire us in unfathomable depression, and our body aches with longing. We think we cannot live, and indeed, the urge to kill oneself over the loss of love is a universal theme that has plagued people for as long as the force of love has ruled our hearts.  Rejection says we are unworthy and magni es our basic shame to whatever degree we carry it. It turns us against ourselves, creating what is perhaps the deepest wound of all. Why does rejection by another so profoundly a ect our inner state?  For young children, rejection is equivalent to death. Without the love of parents, what guarantee is there that we will be cared for?  For many, the experience of losing love triggers the infantile state of an abandoned child, a state of intolerable helplessness totally incongruent with our adult self.  A child identi es with her parents, imitating their behavior and adopting their values as she learns about life. As adults, when we love someone deeply, we also identify with them to a certain extent.  We identify with their sorrows and pains, their triumphs and joys.  We often share their feelings as if they were our own. When our loved one su ers, we su er with them in our caring. The deeper we love, the more we drop the boundaries of separateness and the stronger our identi cation with the other.  So what happens when we get rejected? If we are still identi ed with the one who is rejecting us, then we adopt the same stance and reject ourselves. For the child who is identi ed with his parents, he will learn to devalue himself, even to hate himself. For the adult who loses his beloved, he is left not only with the loss, but also with a negative message from someone he respects saying he is awed, unworthy, and unwanted! If the relationship has been a close one, then he has probably shared many values and is likely to buy into his lover’s rejection as a statement of truth about himself. So we identify with the deserter and dis-identify with ourselves. We move against the natural self-acceptance of this chakra and move instead toward self-rejection and grief.  Some people, when rejected, get angry instead of sad. This is often a means of self-preservation, as it breaks the negative bonding and overidenti cation. When we say, “You lousy sonuvabitch, how could you? I didn’t deserve this!” we cease to identify with the cause of our pain and stand a better chance of reidentifying with ourselves.  Sometimes, however, rejection does uncover truths we need to face. There is seldom a louder wake-up call than the actual or threatened loss of someone we love. As a force for change, it is one of the strongest, but also one of the hardest. Too much anger may obscure the powerful lessons that are presenting themselves.  It is important to di erentiate between overidenti cation with the lover and truths we need to learn. If there are important lessons to be learned, we need to face them with an attitude of self-compassion, as there is no time when compassion is more needed than in the depths of grief. It is compassion alone that allows us to  reconnect with the self and stop identifying with the parent, lover, or friend who has betrayed, rejected, or devalued us. The grief must be shed, and in that grief, connection to the core self can be made once again.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: CHARACTER STRUCTURE THE RIGID   Henry was the character type that is least likely to enter therapy. He was a good-looking, personable, and highly successful CEO in a large company. His body radiated vitality and readiness, with well-toned muscles and erect posture. Had I not been familiar with character structures, I would have wondered what he was doing there.  After a few minutes of hearing Henry speak it became apparent that his energy, though highly charged, was held in the back of his body. As I watched him move, I could see his back was slightly arched and that his arms never reached out very far in front of him when he spoke. His impressive energy was without depth, as if caught in a loop. He admitted to being a mystery to himself. He had had a long string of relationships as many women had fallen in love with him, but somehow he always grew bored and moved on. Henry was trapped in a highly charged energy system that could not open to deeper feelings. Henry’s heart was blocked.  His blocked feelings were largely due to parental rejection, which began during his fourth chakra developmental period. Although originally loving and supportive, his parents suddenly expected him to grow up and chided him for his immature need for love and security. He was no longer allowed to climb on their laps, ask for hugs, or cry when he was sad. The birth of a younger sister diverted the special attention he was used to, and he was now expected to act like a man at the tender age of ve. Henry remembers that on his rst day in kindergarten, he was afraid to get on the school bus.  He cried and clung to his mother and later that night he was deeply  scorned for his childish behavior. He was told that he was too old for that sort of thing and that it would not be tolerated. In order to stop the ow of such feelings, he sti ened his body and restricted his breath. In typical military posture, he pu ed up his chest and gave the appearance of con dence. His chest, however, did not expand and contract with the breath but instead became a tight container for the emotional energy that could not ow outward through the heart (see this page, Rigid Character).  His father, also an ambitious career man, had such high expectations for him that Henry never felt like he was good enough.  In high school, he was a football star and honor roll student. He had fantasies of becoming a great scientist and nally winning his father’s approval. His father, however, was still distant, focused on his own work, and paid attention to Henry only long enough to tell him how he could have done better. His mother stood by silently and supported her husband in this behavior while she poured tenderness on his younger sister.  No matter what Henry did, his authentic self was rejected. Each time he tried to win approval, his heart was broken. Forced to rise above his need for love, he channeled his aggressive energy into achievement, unconsciously hoping it would win the love and recognition he craved. But his heart had long ago been forced to close down, and even when love was forthcoming, as it often was from women, he was unable to experience the satisfaction of being enough. In fact, love given in admiration increases the feeling that there is no love for the authentic, vulnerable self. This does not bring real satisfaction or healing and so the rigid character restlessly moves on.  At the developmental period when Henry’s heart would be most open and inquisitive, he was told to shut down his feelings and perform. This rejection of the true self in favor of the achieving self is what gives this character structure its more positive name of the Achiever. Energetically, Henry shut down both the second and fourth chakras, while squeezing his life force tightly into the third chakra ego/activity center. There it poured out into successful business activity, fueled by drive and ambition (see gure 4.2).  Indeed, it seems a very natural state of a airs for men to have irrational moods and women irrational opinions.  C. G. JUNG  Rigid character types hold back energetically. They are disconnected from their shadow and therefore afraid to surrender to their own feelings. They are out of touch with their inner child, as they were not allowed to be children for very long. No matter what they achieve, they never feel they have enough and can never get to a place where they can just let things be. They are disposed to action without satisfaction, which leaves them in a constant state of frustration. Their energy is channeled into more and greater achievement until they eventually become addicted to substances (cocaine is a particular favorite for this character type) or simply burn out with exhaustion. At this point, life forces a vulnerability that can no longer be denied and healing can begin.  Healing the Achiever requires meeting the vulnerable child on his own ground and letting him feel that he is enough just as he is.  Encouragement of the softer feelings with positive mirroring helps the Rigid type discover his inner emotions and enhance their ow.  Helping him release the binding in the chest and express feeling with the arms unlocks the heart chakra and helps the energy descend into the ground. General techniques will be discussed in the healing section. THE HYSTERIC   Since men are so often robbed of their tears and vulnerability, the Rigid character pattern tends to manifest more often in men.  Women, with more cultural permission to express feelings, tend toward the Hysteric character structure. The original wound is similar—rejection from the father as the child matures, lack of empathy for the child, and high expectations for performance. For the feeling/expressive type, this rejection is met with feelings that  are pushed forward, most often in melodramatic exaggeration, as a way to get the attention she craves. The tendency to express emotions hysterically becomes habitual, and she may not even notice that her reactions are extreme by other people’s standards.  Since she craves love, she focuses heavily on family and relationships with a desire for closeness that becomes demanding and possessive, rather than accepting and inviting. The Hysteric is changeable and highly charged, but her expression is uneven and sporadic, varying from angry outbursts to pouting withdrawal.  The Hysteric has a pear-shaped body—petite and almost childlike above the waist, with larger hips and thighs (see this page, Hysteric Character). The wound to the heart chakra is evident in the rigidity of her chest. She may have trouble breathing when triggered emotionally, which only creates panic and even more extreme emotions. Like the Rigid type, the Hysteric lives chie y in her persona without realizing that she is forfeiting authenticity. She feels most authentic when expressing strong emotions, as this is the way her psyche balances the habitual inhibition of the core self.  Thus she identi es chie y with her social and emotional identities, creating excess in chakra two.  On the positive side, Hysterics can be caring and supportive when their needs are met, and charming in social situations. Some nd their unpredictable nature exciting. Like the Rigid type, they are highly charged and seem very alive (see gure 4.3).  Both the Hysteric and the Rigid/Achiever have developed the ability to close down their heart chakra rapidly and at will. Indeed, the heart only opens tentatively for short, intense periods, as exceptions to its basic distrustful state. They long for closeness, but feeling inadequate they fear that intimacy will reveal their shortcomings. They are usually charming and seductive and well-loved by others, but they seldom believe that their close relationships are authentic since they, themselves, are seldom authentic.  FIGURE 4.2.

Their di culty with reciprocating tenderness might suggest that they are often rejected, but in fact, they are so defended against rejection it is more likely that they will leave a relationship rst.  They unconsciously do to others what they most fear for themselves, thus keeping their heart chakras depleted and perpetuating their original patterns.  In truth, they are hungry for love—real love that is directed toward their feeling self, the nonachieving self, the simple, vulnerable, authentic self connected to the unloved child.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: Excess and Deficiencies EXCESS   It is always somewhat disconcerting to think of an excess in the heart chakra as being a problem, and I repeatedly get questions about this in my workshops. How can we have too much love? How can the heart be too open? Do we really need to limit ourselves as we open the heart? Is there a proper level of openness to aim for?  In order to develop love—universal love, cosmic love, whatever you would like to call it—one must accept the whole situation of life as it is, both the light and the dark, the good and the bad.  CHOGYAM TRUNGPA  Excess in the heart chakra is not an excess of actual love, but an excessive use of love for our own needs. Excess occurs when we overcompensate for our own wounds. Since love, by nature, involves others, then others become victims in our drama of overcompensating. Excessive love is desperate in its need for constant assurance, and does not uphold another’s freedom to be who they are. It is love that is used like a drug, where the goal is to get high and remove ourselves from our responsibilities and unresolved pain. We are in excess when we use love to compensate for the incompleteness in ourselves, or when we use another to go  where we cannot or will not go ourselves (see gure 4.4).      FIGURE 4.4. FOURTH CHAKRA EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY  Connie complained that she gained ve pounds during her mother’s last visit. “What happened?” I asked. “Mom kept wanting to take care of me, to feed me, to do everything for me. If I objected she got terribly hurt, claiming that I was rejecting her love. So I ate food when I wasn’t hungry. I didn’t do my normal workout routine.  I didn’t return my business calls. I got behind in everything.”  What Connie’s mother assumed was loving behavior was actually smothering her daughter. Her mother’s hurt about having her noble e orts rejected was proof that the gifts were not really given for Connie’s well-being but for her own. Connie’s mother is a codependent, but in listening to the story we can see that Connie is codependent as well. Rather than risk her mother’s hurt, she went against her own needs. She did not enjoy the visit, and was not looking forward to the next one.  By de nition, the heart chakra is about reaching beyond the self and connecting with others. Codependency expresses an excessive heart chakra, where the emphasis on the other is out of balance. The  compulsive need to xate on others with excessive caretaking and meddling is a behavior that arises from our own denied needs for such care. Out of touch with our own needs, we hope this behavior will earn the right to be loved in return. Yet this denies the other’s self-reliance. Codependency is not an act of love, but an obsession clothed in the guise of love.  An excessive heart chakra can be demanding and possessive. It is passionately connected, but often blindly so. Love becomes an obsession in which the loved one is more an extension of ourselves than a separate being. Jealousy is a projection of our insecurities, a product of the hungry heart. Eros and Thanatos are out of balance.  We crave connection and cannot tolerate separation. A jealous person needs constant reassurance and attention and their neediness tends to result in a rejection that only deepens the underlying wound and creates even more insecurity.  Since the need for love is so strong in the excessive heart chakra, there may be poor boundaries and poor discrimination. We may fail to discern when a relationship becomes abusive and live in the fantasy bond where everything is just ne. There may be idealistic thinking about the perfection of love that continually gets betrayed by hard, cold reality. We may expect the moon from our lover—  even be willing to give it ourselves—and fail to see why our expectations are not matched in kind. The excessive focus on love is like an addiction that undermines clarity and judgment.    DEFICIENCY   Alan was going through a divorce. “I’ll never fall in love again,” he declared. “It is not worth it. This hurts too much.” His friends all told him he would nd someone else before too long. “I don’t want someone else!” he exclaimed. “This one was perfect. If I can’t have it, I’m never going to make a commitment again!”  Alan was reacting to his wound with an avoidant response. He was closing shop—no more business, no more risk. I knew that Alan was actually a very loving person, so I knew his response was not permanent. Having had his heart opened and then broken, it was  natural for him to shut down for a while. Unfortunately, some people adopt this as a basic stance during childhood and for them, shutting down becomes a more serious condition.  The de cient heart chakra responds to wounds of love by withdrawing. Having been hurt before, the heart becomes a closed system and love becomes conditional. It says, “If you don’t treat me better, I won’t give you any more love.” “If you don’t call me on time, I’ll pretend I don’t care.” The heart plays a game of coldness, as if the withdrawal of love can manipulate someone into loving us more. Feeling depleted to begin with, a de cient heart wants others to make the rst move. What a contrast to the codependent that gives compulsively whether it is wanted or not!  The de cient heart chakra is usually waiting for a knight in shining armor or a fairy godmother to come along and play rescue.  He or she wants someone to see how hurt they are, and to x it.  They want energy to be poured into the system without taking any  risks themselves, as risks have proved painful in the past (see gure  4.4). As the heart is basically depleted, one feels they cannot a ord  to open and give. Without giving, the inner economy collapses and depression sets in. Like having a dead battery, we keep waiting for a jump start. If we never let the battery charge, we need that jump start continually.  With a de cient heart chakra, there is a tendency to dwell on old relationships that ended long ago because it was a time when one felt loved. One might remain stuck in anger and betrayal and never forgive. The fact that the heart did not get lled up is seen as the other person’s fault rather than one’s own responsibility.  Unwillingness to forgive keeps the heart closed.  The de cient heart chakra is an avoidant response to too little love. Since the unloved child did not get met with empathy for their experience, they have trouble giving empathy to others (as well as themselves). They lack compassion and remain critical and judgmental, which hurts the people they love and closes channels for expression and reception.  Past hurts may result in bitterness and cynicism—a kind of generic intolerance. Judgment is a way of justifying distance from  others and defending against closeness and the risk of getting hurt again. If others are not good enough, then we can feel righteous instead of rejected. Loss of love reduces self-esteem and our righteousness gives us a false sense of pride. We are better than others who are not worthy of our love. This is a projection of our own emptiness and unworthiness. It is likely we will judge ourselves with the same lack of compassion.  David spent several sessions bemoaning the fact that he could never say, “I love you.” He was capable of love, but feared expressing it. His heart chakra was so wounded that he felt he could not a ord the risk of rejection. Without opening those channels, he also could not receive the love his friends had for him and remained isolated and lonely. If one complains of basic loneliness, it is likely the heart chakra is de cient. There are so many people in this world who need love—perhaps we are a bit too picky if we can’t nd any?  A de cient heart chakra feels basically unlovable at the core.  When engaged in a relationship, one fears that intimacy may reveal this basic, unacceptable core. If there is not enough self-love to promote pride in one’s interior, it remains hidden and unrevealed.  Without intimacy, the heart does not get lled, and so the cycle perpetuates itself.   COMBINATIONS   And the day came when the need to remain closed became more painful than the risk to open.  ANONYMOUS  You may have read these two sections and found yourself identifying with both. It is common to go back and forth at di erent times in life. I tend toward codependence myself, until I get hurt, at which point I withdraw and shut down. When I am in love, I am    over owing and have extra for everybody. When I feel rejected, I tell everybody to go away and leave me alone even though I secretly want someone to take care of me.  When a heart has been too open, it is natural for it to shut down.  When the heart has experienced enough loneliness, it may be ready to open up again. We may feel full of love one day, and angry and resentful the next. We may have some de cient or excessive characteristics, but not all of our characteristics are so. What is important is to examine the basic stance we take in life and to bring that stance into balance whenever we can.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: HEALING THE HEART CHAKRA   Love comforteth like sunshine after a rain.  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE  Love is the essence that heals. Patience, skill, training, and talent all play their part, but without love they are merely techniques. All wounds cry for the universal medicine of love. As the cosmic glue of the universe, love is the force that bridges the gaps that cut us asunder. In the gap between Heaven and Earth, love is the binding force that holds together the many-colored steps of the Rainbow Bridge.  Unfortunately, due to the damage we have each received in our lives, we are not always sure how to apply love to the wounds  within ourselves and others. We do not know what real love looks like or how to create it.  The following suggestions only scratch the surface of this vast subject, but give you a place to begin.  THE TASK OF SELF-ACCEPTANCE  In order to love, there has to be someone home inside. As we open up to the more universal elements of love, it is easy to forget to honor each other’s individuality. Soulful love, as Thomas Moore has so aptly stated, is neither abstract nor empty, but worships the particular, the unique, the individuated self.  In honoring our individuality, we honor the subtle relationships within ourselves. We honor the individuality of every composite part: the part that seeks success, the part that fears it, the part that longs for commitment, the part that wants freedom, the inner child, the rebellious teenager, the pleaser, the nurturing parent, and all the other selves we observe as we go through life. They may want di erent things at di erent times, or even di erent things at the same time.  Learning to coordinate these internal relationships is the inner work of self-love. Our feelings are brought into relationship with our belief systems; our vulnerable child forms an alliance with our responsible adult; our inner masculine makes love with the inner feminine. Our inner critic, rather than permeating every thought, becomes realistically related to our self-protection. The parts are many and the combinations in nite. Only through this relational process do we form a sense of the whole.  It is not enough to merely recognize the pieces of ourselves—we need to reclaim them with that sense of bonding we call love.  Recognizing each part as an essential element of the whole brings our disparate selves home to the integrating chamber of the heart.  The heart’s natural inclination is to create bonding. Just as heart cells under a microscope will always beat in unison, so too, our various subpersonalities will form a harmonious unity when they are brought into the loving awareness of the heart chakra. What is  not brought into relationship with the core essence of the heart remains outside of the whole, an unacknowledged part. In chakra two, for example, we talked about these parts as rejected selves or the shadow.  As we re ect upon ourselves, we integrate more and more pieces of ourselves. Our sense of the whole becomes larger and stronger.  Like an ecosystem whose stability and magni cence increases with diversity, the whole of a person gains beauty and stability as more and more parts become integrated. We become more complex, more mature, and capable of greater and greater possibilities. This sets the ground for creativity in chakra ve, and for penetrating insight and understanding in chakras six and seven. Re ective consciousness allows this integration and it is the task usually undertaken through psychotherapy.  As we become more integrated, we become more relational. Our capacity for understanding and working with outer relationships is enhanced by the sophistication of our inner one. Instead of relating from a single part of ourselves, which makes us in exible, we have a broader base from which to relate. There is simply more there for another to be attracted to, and more of us there to meet them. If we have accepted our own inner child, we can better accept that aspect in another.  Self-acceptance sets the stage for our social identity. It allows us to understand complex social interdependence and the sense of collective identity we all need to develop at this time in history.  Having the capacity to perceive, understand, and form relationships is essential to this process. We can then see our role within the complex web of relationships around us, and can bring balance to the larger components of our culture.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}

Whenever our feelings are hurt (especially as children) we react protectively and close down our feelings.

When we hold back our feelings, we hold our breath. When we hold the breath, we restrict the vital nourishment of air to our cells and muscles, and in e ect, deaden ourselves. Deepening the breath allows repressed feelings to surface and be mobilized, freeing the heart from the heaviness of grief and allowing the natural balance of taking in and letting go to be restored.  It is advisable to do breath work with a trusted friend or therapist who can act as a container, catalyst, or anchor for your feelings as they emerge.

We do not feel how we hold the breath or constrict various parts of the belly or chest. Our way of breathing is normal to us.  The rst step in breath work is to feel your own breathing and have someone else watch you breathe. Let him or her give you feedback on whether you hold your breath at any part of the breathing cycle. Some people hold for a few moments before they exhale, while others hold their breath for a short time before taking the next breath. Allow the breath to become smooth and balanced in its cycle. Notice whether you breathe from your chest or your belly, and see what happens when you consciously expand the parts that are normally restricted. Notice what feelings, impulses, and desires arise. Try not to block these feelings.  REACHING OUT AND TAKING IN WITH THE BREATH  A simple but profound exercise for opening the heart coordinates the reaching out and taking in movement of the arms with the exhale and inhale of the breath. The instructions given here are for the facilitator.  STEP ONE: Have your friend lay down on a mat with knees bent, so that the feet have contact with the ground. Notice the breathing that is already there and become aware of its rhythms. Gently encourage awareness of the parts that are held and those that do not seem to expand or contract with the breath. If your partner is comfortable with touch, you might bring attention to the held parts by gently touching them. It also helps to lightly massage the shoulders and arms, the pectoral muscles that join the shoulders to the chest, and the area of the back behind the heart chakra. If the heart area is constricted to a point where the back is rounded forward, I  sometimes put a pillow under the heart that encourages the back to arch in the opposite direction. Once the breath seems as full as possible and your friend has relaxed into it, you are ready to begin the next step.  STEP TWO: Encourage your partner to reach her arms forward with each exhale, and to pull her arms in toward the heart chakra with each inhale. These motions should be slow and conscious. When we pull in, it helps to imagine just what we are reaching for in terms of love. When we exhale, imagine what we are either letting go of, or what we are o ering to the world. For example, one might suggest:  “Think of the things that make you feel loved, and pull them toward you.” “Imagine letting go of the fear of rejection.” “O er the love from your own heart as you push outward.”  After a few moments of this, you may notice which of these motions is easier for your partner; there may be hesitation, or blockage in one direction more than another. Simply point out this observation and see if your friend is aware of it.  STEP THREE: Stand over your partner and grab onto her hands. When she pulls her arms in toward her heart, o er a bit of resistance.  When she pushes away, o er resistance as well. Your resistance increases the ow of energy through the arms and often opens up blocked feelings. Again, simply observe what happens and o er feedback on what you observe.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: GRIEF WORK   Unshed grief restricts the breath, and deepening the breath often releases grief. Grief is like heavy clouds in the air that obscure the sky, but once the rain is shed the sky opens up to let the sun shine again.  Grief is nearly always based on loss, especially of loved ones. It is important to reclaim that part of us that was attached to what we lost. The grown woman who lost her daddy when she was a little  girl may have simultaneously lost her inner child. The nurturing husband who lost his wife may lose the part of himself that was tender and open. The self that feels playful, sexual, creative, or enthusiastic about life may have been lost when the lover that brought out these qualities moves on. We can tolerate the loss of a love object, but not the loss of vital pieces of ourselves.  It is important to remember that the point of grief work is to regain connection with the self inside rather than increase our attachment to what was lost. We must remember to ask ourselves,  “Why was this person in particular so special to me?” “What did he or she bring to me that I am missing in myself?” “What part of me was particularly bonded to this person, and what does that part need?” “What have I lost touch with in myself as a result of this ending, and how can I nurture and regain that part of myself once again?”  We grieve because a sacred essence within ourselves has been awakened and then compromised. To grieve that essence is to reclaim it and give it the importance it deserves. Sometimes a painful situation triggers wounds from previous hurts that were never healed and indeed we may we feel like we are reexperiencing every hurt that has ever happened to us. Grief work helps us clean the wounds so that we reclaim our wholeness.  As we shed the seemingly endless tears of grief, we must remember the hope of the young boy in the stable: “With this much manure, there’s got to be a pony in here somewhere!” Grief work leads us to the pony.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: FORGIVENESS   When our heart is injured, we protect it from the one we believe has caused it harm. Often we blame him or her for the pain, forgetting the part we may have played in it ourselves. Blame acts as a barricade that protects us from opening to that person again.  Unfortunately, when we barricade our heart we also barricade it against receiving, as well as the possibility of healing. We stay frozen in the past, unable to move forward into the future.  Likewise, when we blame ourselves for something we regret, we stay locked into that past event. We remain xated in the state of the helpless child, the out-of-control adult, or the withdrawn lover, stuck in a pattern of shame that does not allow us to be fully present.  Forgiveness is said to be the ultimate step in healing. Forgiveness uses the compassion of the heart to understand situations in terms of the forces that were acting on both ourselves and others. We may still vehemently disagree with the actions taken. We may say, rightfully, that we would never have done such a thing. We may even need something from the other person in order to allow forgiveness—an apology, some kind of restitution, or an acknowledgment of harm. But in the end, forgiveness allows the heart to lighten and move on; it is the redemptive action of the heart.  The rst step is to forgive ourselves. This is not to say we should blindly condone every thoughtless action we have ever taken. We need to look at ourselves compassionately, seeing the yearnings of the soul and what it was trying to accomplish, seeing the obstacles that were in our way, and the forces that impinged upon our journey at that time. It means that we understand why we did what we did and separate our basic essence from the mistake that was made.  Forgiving ourselves may require making amends for past action.  This is an important step in recovery from addictions, for it restores balance and returns us to a position of conscious responsibility.  Look over your life and make a list of the things for which you have not forgiven yourself. Go back over each one of them and recreate the scenario that led to your actions. See if you can identify what part of you was activated at the time—the hungry child, the overworked adult, the rejected wife, the desperate teenager. Work toward an understanding of what you did and allow yourself to connect with the feelings you may not have been able to acknowledge at the time. Imagine how you might react if you saw another child (wife, husband, daughter, etc.) do the same thing and knew all about their situation. Would you be more or less  judgmental? What is the expectation you had of yourself at the time? What was the expectation that was held of you by others?  Were these expectations realistic?  Treat the part of you that was activated in your mind’s eye with compassion. Look at what it needed, what it was trying to nd. See if you can o er it forgiveness. Try to say these words to yourself, “I forgive you. You were just trying to.… Maybe we can help you achieve that now in a more productive way.”  Forgiving others for harm they have caused is often more di cult.  Some people try to forgive immediately before working through the grief and anger they have sustained. They say, “Oh, it doesn’t matter. That’s just how my father was. He couldn’t help that he was so angry.” This might be true, but it minimizes the impact such actions have on the soul and the e ort it takes to stop the patterns it created in our lives.  Once we work through our feelings about a situation and reclaim pieces that were lost, then forgiveness lets us move onward.  Forgiveness is an organic process and cannot be forced against its own time, although it can be encouraged.  We follow the same steps in forgiving someone else as we do for ourselves. We ask, what were the forces acting on the person at the time? What were they trying to achieve? What was driving them?  What was unavailable that they needed? What blocked them from being able to respond di erently? What might have been their true intentions had they been more conscious? What do I need from this person to help the forgiveness process (if it is possible)? What do I need from myself in order to forgive them and move on?  Forgiveness softens the hardening of the heart and so renews openness. It is not meant as a process that allows the same thing to happen again, but it will allow greater awareness to evolve in situations that have gone awry. It allows us to unhook the energy from the negative past and free it up for a more positive future.  LOVE MUST BE WILLED AND CREATED, AS WELL AS FELT  We tend to think of love as a feeling of which we are passive recipients. When love ebbs and ows, as surely it will, we think we are helpless to do anything about it. Stephen R. Covey, author of The Seven Habits of Highly E ective People, shares advice he gave to a man who felt he no longer loved his wife nor was loved in return.  “Love her,” he told the man.  “I told you, the feeling just isn’t there anymore,” the man replied.  “Love her,” Covey replied.  “You don’t understand. The feeling of love just isn’t there,”  repeated the man.  “Then love her. If the feeling isn’t there, that’s a good reason to love her.”  “But how do you love when you do not love?” asked the man.  Covey replied: “My friend, love is a verb. Love—the feeling—is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacri ce. Listen to her.  Empathize. Appreciate. A rm her. Are you willing to do that?”10  Love is a feeling, yes, but a feeling that is created out of action.  The fourth chakra sits neatly above the third chakra will. Love is a daily, even hourly, conscious commitment to behave in a loving and caring fashion toward ourselves and others. When the feeling fades, it is our responsibility to nd ways to create new love. Like a garden that is carefully tended, the rewards are well worth the e ort.  For those of us who are unsure about what love even looks like, it is helpful to use fantasy. In fantasy, we can imagine our ideal mom or dad, or our ideal lover. We can imagine how they would speak to us, what they would do for us. In the fantasy, it is important to let the feelings fully permeate the body. As I say to my clients: “Soak your cells in this feeling. Reprogram the body with this nourishment.” It is often helpful to begin this fantasy imagining ourselves at a young age and gradually growing up with this feeling present. How would it have felt at three years old to have had this kind of support and love? How would it have felt to go to school if you had had this kind of love? How would it have felt going through puberty? Would you walk, talk, or reach out di erently?  What would college have been like? How would your marriage or  your relationship to your children be di erent? Fantasy helps reprogram the chakra through a succession of developmental stages.  LOVE MUST RISE BEYOND THE SELF  The purpose of the fourth chakra in the system as a whole is to get us to expand beyond our limited egos into a wider sense of connection with all life. This is the movement of the liberating current. While it is important not to deny or neglect the smaller self, it is indeed a liberating experience to rise beyond the con nes of our own needs and nd joy in service and altruism.  In my workshops, we give our students an assignment in the heart chakra to do something unexpected, even outrageous, for another person. It may be a favor for a neighbor you rarely speak to or a house cleaning for your wife in the middle of the night. It may be giving one hundred dollars to a panhandler or taking two days o work to spend exclusively with your children.  The joy this action imparts is contagious. Not only do you get uplifted yourself, but the person who receives your generosity will be touched in the heart, and inspired to carry it on elsewhere. How will they treat others after you make their day?  For those who consider themselves hopelessly codependent, this act of sel ess service may only reinforce what they are already doing. For them, we give an even harder assignment: Do something outrageous for yourself!", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
{"include_sources": false, "system_prompt": "", "prompt": "Summarize the following: LOVE MUST MAINTAIN A BALANCE OF ENERGIES  We think the heart chakra should be wide open, but in reality, few people can tolerate such a state in our crowded and traumatized social milieu. If we cannot monitor our boundaries, the heart will unconsciously shut down. The inner self will not feel protected and will simply withdraw.  Many people have di culty balancing intimacy and autonomy in a relationship. They try to favor one side over the other and fail to realize they need both. The following exercise is similar to that of  reaching out and taking in, but awakens the active rather than passive aspects of love.  COME CLOSER, GO AWAY  Seat yourself in front of your partner either cross-legged or in a chair. Let your hands meet between you at heart level. Allow your partner to pull your hands in toward his heart while he says aloud,  “Come closer.” O er some resistance to the pull—not enough to block the movement, but enough to require real e ort. When the hands reach the heart, allow your partner to push your hands back away from his body, saying aloud, “Go away.” Again, o er some resistance to the push.  Go back and forth between these two modes, allowing any feelings or resistances to arise. Often one or the other movement will dominate and the person will realize they actually want more closeness or distance. You can then support them in their feeling by focusing on that movement.  Then change places. Now it is your turn to push and pull, and your partner’s turn to o er resistance and feedback.  If you do this with someone with whom you have a relationship, ask how it mirrors what happens between the two of you. Who does the pushing, pulling, and resisting? What e ect does it have? Is it balanced?      CONCLUSION   Love is not what we become but who we already are.  STEPHEN LEVINE  The heart chakra brings us to a place of acceptance and openness that allows the spirit inside to be still and nd peace and stability    without constriction. If the third chakra below has done its work correctly, we have created a place where the fourth chakra can now let go and just be. The state of being as opposed to doing is the qualitative di erence between chakras four and three.  Healing the heart involves attending to the most vulnerable and sacred aspects within ourselves. Only through attending to their truth can we drop the protective armor that keeps us bound to the ego, bound to smaller parts of ourselves. Manipulation, derision, criticisms, or command will not work. We can only melt the armor with the combination of feeling and understanding that is love.  Through love we are able to expose our instinctual core and evolve to the next step of expressing our truth. Through love we are able to embrace and heal the larger world around us. Relationship furthers the evolution of individual souls and the collective soul of our planet.", "stream": false, "use_context": false}
