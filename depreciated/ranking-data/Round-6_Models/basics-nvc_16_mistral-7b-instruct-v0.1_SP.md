### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

Notes:

I. Introduction
A. You mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that?
B. A friend of yours says this to you: I'm a nothing I'll never amount to anything look at... I'm an assistant clerk at 8's 45 my brother's a head of his company my sister's a top attorney and I'm a nothing okay?
C. To enjoy this person's suffering, we have to release ourselves from two kinds of responsibility:
1. That we didn't cause the pain that we want to release ourselves from
2. The hard one to think - that we have to fix it to make the person feel better

II. Releasing Responsibility
A. We don't want to in any way think we caused this person's pain because we can't cause another person's psychological pain.
B. The person wasn't saying that, so it's easy to liberate ourselves from feeling responsible.
C. However, the second responsibility is harder to think - that we have to fix it to make the person feel better.
D. The more we try to fix things ourselves, the more we make it worse because we can't fix people.

III. Empathy and Healing Energy
A. To help the healing energy do its job, we need empathy.
B. Empathy requires presence - just being present when we are with the person.
C. The precious connection between the person and us is what I mean by enjoyment.
D. When we are present with the person, whether they're feeling joy or pain, that's what I mean by enjoyment.
E. We block that beautiful energy whenever we step in and try to fix things ourselves.
F. Instead of giving advice, we should be present and let the healing energy work through us.

IV. Example
A. You're feeling really discouraged and frustrated because you haven't achieved as much in your life as you wanted.
B. You would really have liked to make different use of some things than you have.
C. Instead of trying to fix it, you should be present and let the healing energy work through you.
D. The precious connection that results from this is what I mean by enjoyment, and it does the healing, not your advice or whatever.

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

Summary:

* Empathizing vs Encouraging and Supporting: The distinction between empathizing and encouraging and supporting someone who is suffering is subtle. While being there for them can be a form of encouragement, it can also be seen as keeping the \"soap opera\" going if the person continues to talk about the past without any progress towards healing.
* Healing through Talking About the Present: Instead of focusing solely on talking about the past, it is more effective to talk about what is alive in us now and how it has been stimulated by the past. This allows for a deeper connection and can lead to healing.
* Interrupting to Bring Conversation to Life: If someone continues to talk about the past without any progress towards healing, interrupting and bringing the conversation to life can be helpful. By connecting at a deeper level, the person may stop talking about the past and begin to heal.
* Last Question: The speaker would like to cover a specific subject before ending the conversation.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 

Notes:

* The speaker discusses the idea that emotional pain cannot be caused by others, but rather it is up to us to determine our emotional reactions.
* They give examples of people who have experienced different emotional reactions to the same stimulus, such as rage and deep feelings versus no anger at all.
* The speaker mentions working with women who have been raped and how their emotional reactions vary depending on how they take in the stimulus.
* They also discuss a woman from Rwanda who heard her children being killed and how she was able to protect herself but never experienced anger towards those who killed them.
* The speaker emphasizes that accountability lies with the person responsible for the actions, not with the victim's emotional reaction.
* They also mention the importance of empathy in helping a child deal with their emotions and avoid creating unnecessary pain for themselves.

### okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get t

Notes:

I. Introduction

* The speaker is discussing the importance of celebrating life and expressing gratitude in Giraffe communication.
* They argue that this is essential for staying true to our nature and living a fulfilling life in a \"jackalish\" world.

II. Jackals Say Thank You

* The speaker argues that moralistic judgments, positive or negative, are equally as violent as each other.
* Using \"thank you\" as a reward to reinforce behavior is dehumanizing and destroys the beauty of gratitude.

III. Building Up Self-Esteem

* The speaker argues that complimenting someone to build up their self-esteem can be counterproductive.
* It can create an addiction to rewards, reducing the person's ability to feel good about themselves without external validation.

IV. How Giraffes Say Thank You

* The speaker outlines three key components of expressing gratitude in Giraffe communication:
	1. Concretely bringing attention to what the other person has done that made life more wonderful.
	2. Expressing how we feel about the person's actions at that moment.
	3. Seeing what need of ours was fulfilled by their actions and expressing gratitude for that.

V. Example of Gratitude in Giraffe Communication

* The speaker provides an example of a woman who came up to them after a workshop and expressed her gratitude in Giraffe communication.
* She specifically mentioned two things the speaker had said that made her feel hopeful and relieved, and how it fulfilled a need of hers to connect with her son.

### it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now ove

Summary:

* Gratitude is a powerful concept that can have both positive and negative effects on individuals.
* Jackals, in particular, may be scared of receiving gratitude due to their dangerous concept of \"deserve.\"
* This concept implies that appreciation is only given to those who deserve it, which can lead to a destructive economic and correctional system.
* Humility is also a factor in why jackals may be scared of receiving gratitude.
* The Course of Miracles suggests that our light (our true selves) scares us the most, as we have been educated to hate ourselves and think there is something wrong with us.
* Gratitude observation, feeling, and need should come from the heart and not be used for praise, compliment, or reward.
* The speaker is grateful for the time and attention given during the conversation.
