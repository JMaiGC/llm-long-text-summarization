TEXT: i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal

1. Summary of the situation:

	* They also have a dynamic with their mother where she wants to control every aspect of their trip, but they want to be left alone.
2. Key concepts:
	* Undoable: An action or behavior that can be changed or undone.
	* Paradoxical bind: A situation where the speaker feels trapped by their partner's expectations and reactions.
3. Empathy and communication strategies:
	1. Start with empathy: Understand the other person's intentions and feelings before expressing one's own needs.
	2. Honest expression of feelings: Clearly communicate one's feelings and needs without blaming or accusing the other person.
	3. Active listening: Ensure that the other person understands what one is saying by asking them to summarize it back.
4. Application to the situation:
	1. Intimate partner: The speaker should start with empathy, express their need for happiness, and ask for an action that can lead to that happiness. They should also clarify that they don't want to be blamed for their mood.
	2. Mother: The speaker should communicate their need for space and autonomy in planning their trip, ensure their mother understands their intentions, and avoid feeling rejected or misunderstood.

### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

1. Understanding Enjoying Suffering:
* Release self from two kinds of responsibility:
	+ Caused the pain (not applicable in this case)
	+ Belief that it's our job to fix the person's pain (common mistake)
2. Empathy as a Healing Tool:
* Presence: Being present with the person without trying to fix their problems
* Remember Buddhist advice: Don't do something, stand there
* Precious Connection: The connection between the person in pain and the empathetic listener that allows healing to occur
3. Blocking the Healing Energy:
* Trying to fix problems (interferes with natural healing process)
* Giving advice (can make situation worse)
4. Encouraging Empathy:
* Example: A person feeling discouraged and frustrated about their lack of achievements in life
* Being present without trying to fix the problem allows for a precious connection that leads to healing

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

1. Empathizing vs Encouraging:
* Empathizing: Understanding and sharing feelings of someone who is suffering (e.g., listening without judgment)
* Encouraging: Subtly pushing someone to move past their suffering by focusing on present emotions and experiences
1. Distinction between empathizing and encouraging:
* Encouraging vs Rehashing Past Suffering:
	+ Encouraging: Asking questions about the past can keep the conversation focused on healing, not just rehashing the past
	+ Rehashing Past Suffering: Allowing someone to talk endlessly about their past without interruption may perpetuate their suffering
1. Interrupting and Bringing Conversation to Life:
* Interrupting: Breaking the cycle of past-focused conversation by addressing present emotions
* Bringing Conversation to Life: Introducing new perspectives or experiences that can stimulate healing and growth
1. Healing through Present Emotions:
* Past Experiences: Not the sole determinant of healing; focusing on present emotions and experiences is crucial for healing
* Present Emotions: Stimulated by past experiences but centered on what's happening now, allowing for growth and healing

1. Emotional Pain:
* Stimulus: The presence of emotional pain in one's life due to past experiences or current situations.
* Response: How an individual chooses to deal with their emotional pain, which can be influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, upbringing, and experiences.
1. Rwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone:
* Work in these regions involves helping individuals who have experienced severe trauma, such as the loss of family members or personal violence.
* Differing emotional reactions to similar stimuli: Some individuals may experience rage, while others may feel no anger or deep shame.
1. Case Study: Rwandan Woman:
* Experienced severe trauma: Hearing her children and husband being killed, hiding underneath the sink for eleven days to avoid being killed herself.
* Emotional response: Deep feelings of loss and protection, but no rage towards those who committed the violence against her family.
1. Accountability:
* The responsibility of an individual lies in how they choose to deal with their emotional pain, not in causing it.
* The responsibility of others lies in their actions that caused the pain.
1. Children's Emotional Development:
* Teaching children to cope with trauma without inflicting further pain on them is crucial.
* Empathy plays a significant role in this process, allowing the child to understand and express their feelings.
1. Debunking the Myth of Jackal:
* The term \"Jackal\" refers to individuals who seek revenge or cause harm to others due to past traumas.
* This concept is debunked as it assumes that all individuals who experience trauma will react in the same way, which is not true.
