so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right?

### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

1. **Enjoying Suffering:**
   - **Elaboration on Enjoying Suffering**: To enjoy someone else's suffering, one must release themselves from two kinds of responsibility: (a) feeling responsible for causing the pain and (b) feeling responsible for fixing it. This involves letting go of the belief that we caused the other person's pain and not trying to fix their problems.
   - **Releasing Responsibility**: To release ourselves from the first kind of responsibility, we must recognize that we did not cause the other person's pain, especially if they are blaming us for it. For the second kind of responsibility, we must understand that we cannot fix another person's psychological pain and trying to do so will only make things worse.
   - **Empathy**: Empathy is key to enjoying someone else's suffering. It requires presence, which means being fully present with the other person without trying to fix their problems or give advice. This allows a \"precious connection\" between the two individuals that can lead to healing.
   - **Blocking Healing Energy**: We block this healing energy by trying to fix things ourselves. When we step in and try to offer solutions, we interfere with the natural process of healing.
   - **Enjoyment**: Enjoyment is not about feeling joy or pain alongside the other person but about appreciating the \"precious connection\" that exists between them and us. This connection does the healing work, not our advice or actions.

2. **Text Summary:**
   - **Friend's Lamentation**: A friend laments their perceived lack of success compared to their siblings. They feel like a \"nothing,\" an assistant clerk while their brother is a head of his company and their sister is a top attorney.
   - **Releasing Responsibility**: The speaker emphasizes the need to release ourselves from responsibility for causing another person's pain and from feeling responsible for fixing it. This involves recognizing that we did not cause the other person's pain and understanding that we cannot fix their psychological issues.
   - **Empathy**: Empathy is crucial in enjoying someone else's suffering. It requires presence, which means being fully present without trying to fix things or give advice. This allows for a \"precious connection\" between the two individuals that can lead to healing.
   - **Blocking Healing Energy**: Trying to fix things blocks the natural flow of healing energy. When we step in with solutions, we interfere with the process and make it worse.
   - **Enjoyment**: Enjoyment is not about feeling joy or pain alongside the other person but about appreciating the connection that exists between them and us. This connection does the healing work, not our actions or advice.

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

1. **Empathizing vs Encouraging Soap Opera:**
   - Empathizing is understanding and sharing another person's feelings, while encouraging soap opera involves passively listening to someone's suffering without actively helping them move forward.
   - Encouraging soap opera can be subtle when it comes from a place of genuine concern but may also lead to the victim becoming stuck in their story.
2. **Subtle Encouragement:**
   - Subtle encouragement is about guiding someone towards healing by focusing on what's happening now rather than dwelling on past events.
   - This involves interrupting when someone talks about the past and redirecting the conversation to the present, where healing can occur.
3. **Healing Through Conversation:**
   - Healing doesn't come from talking about the past; it comes from addressing the emotions that are alive in the present moment.
   - By interrupting when someone talks about the past and focusing on what's happening now, a therapist can help their client move towards healing.
4. **Interrupting Past-Focused Conversations:**
   - Interrupting conversations about the past is not to dismiss the past but to bring attention to the present emotions that are being triggered by it.
   - This helps the client understand how the past affects them in the present and can lead to healing.
5. **Healing Through Present-Focused Conversations:**
   - By focusing on what's happening now, a therapist can help their client process their emotions and move towards healing.
   - This involves connecting with the client at an emotional level and helping them understand how their past experiences are affecting their present life.
6. **Last Question and Subject Coverage:**
   - The last question is likely about the subject that will be covered before the end of the conversation, which may relate to the distinction between empathizing and encouraging soap opera or the importance of focusing on the present for healing.

### it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now ove

1. **It's also important how we receive gratitude:**
   - **Jackal receives gratitude**: Jackals are known for their survival instincts. When a jackal is offered a ride by someone, it feels very grateful because it has a need to spend more time with its family. If the jackal took the bus, it would have an hour less time with its family, which is nothing compared to the value of spending time with loved ones.
   - **Expressing love or appreciation**: Jackals are sensitive creatures. When they receive genuine expressions of love or appreciation, they can become nervous because they may not feel like they deserve it. This nervousness stems from a dangerous concept in their head called \"deserve,\" which implies that one must earn appreciation and punishment for certain behaviors.
   - **The concept of \"deserve\"**: The concept of \"deserve\" is a key ingredient in a violent way of life. It sets up an economic system where things are worth more than others, and it can lead to a destructive correctional system. This concept is dangerous because it creates a hierarchy based on perceived value rather than intrinsic worth.
   - **Humility**: Jackals may also feel nervous when they receive gratitude because of their need for humility. There are different kinds of humility, and the jackal's kind can be self-defeating. It's important to distinguish between a healthy form of humility that recognizes one's limitations and a destructive form that leads to self-loathing.
   - **Our light scares us**: The Course in Miracles suggests that our light, not our darkness, is what scares us the most. We have been educated to hate ourselves and think there's something wrong with us. It's a big jump for us to come to terms with our own power to make life wonderful because it challenges our negative self-perception.
   - **Celebrating versus praising**: When we receive gratitude, it's important to celebrate rather than praise or reward. Celebration is about acknowledging and appreciating someone's efforts without attaching conditions or expectations. Praise can be conditional and may lead to a sense of entitlement or obligation.

2. **Last comments or questions**:
   - The speaker thanks the audience for their time and attention, indicating that they value the interaction.
   - They reiterate the importance of receiving gratitude with an open heart, without feeling entitled or deserving.
   - The speaker emphasizes the need to celebrate rather than praise, as celebration is about acknowledging someone's worth without conditions.
   - They remind us that it's a journey to come to terms with our own power and light, but it's a journey worth taking.
