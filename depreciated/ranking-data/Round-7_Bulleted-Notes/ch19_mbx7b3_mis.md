### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

Ingress: Chapter 19 - Urbanization Growing Pains, 1870-1900
Resume: Intro: Sadie Frowne's story reflects immigrants' experiences in the US with new opportunities but challenges.
19.1 Urban Challenges & Solutions:
- Urbanization fast in second half of 19th century due to industrialization, new technologies, and immigration.
- Cities like NY, Boston, Philadelphia expand after mid-1800s as employment options grow.
- Factories moved from river locations to urban centers with the steam engine's development.
- Low wages, monotonous work characterized cities, but core industries shaped their unique characters (e.g., Pittsburgh - steel, Detroit - automobiles).
- Common problems: housing/living conditions, transportation, communication; rooted in class inequality, racial divisions, ethnic conflicts, and corrupt local politics.
Keys to successful urbanization:
1. Electric lighting: Edison's light bulb (1879), commercial power plants (1882) led to 24/7 factory operations, attracting more people.
2. Communication improvements: The telephone (1876), over 1.5 million in use by 1900, accelerated business growth and urban spread.
3. Intracity transport: Essential due to lack of basic infrastructure like efficient public transportation, housing, water supply, or sanitation in growing cities.
4. Rise of skyscrapers: Reflected the need for more space as cities expanded horizontally, but later transformed urban skylines vertically.

### Intracity Transportation


Intracity Transportation: Problem of efficient travel within cities emerged; infra focused on connecting cities. Omni-buses (large, horse-drawn carriages) worked for smaller cities but not large ones due to horses' limits and manure issues. Electric trolleys arrived in 1887 with tracks, electricity replacing horses; ran day & night, modernizing industries in larger cities like Richmond, Virginia. San Francisco adopted mining industry's pulley tech in 1873 for cable cars on steep hills. Larger cities faced transport challenges with trolleys in congested streets; elevated train ("L-Trains") solutions emerged from 1868 New York, 1887 Boston, 1892 Chicago to avoid accidents and traffic.

Urban Skyscrapers: Limitations of large cities included space need, especially for eastern cities with geographic constraints. Skyscraper trend started in 1885 with ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago due to new steel construction techniques. The Otis Elevator Company's electric elevators in 1889 made taller buildings viable, sparking a skyscraper craze in eastern cities.

Jacob Riis and Tenement Conditions: Danish immigrant Riis documented living conditions of New York's working poor, raising awareness through "How the Other Half Lives" (1890). He was reformist, advocating for improved tenements or new ones to curb dangerous conditions and high rents. His photographs and writings spurred public outcry and legislation to protect tenants.

Urban Challenges: Congestion, pollution, crime, disease were common issues in all urban centers. Working-class living spaces were cramped, unsanitary, with rampant diseases like typhoid and cholera. By 1900, Manhattan had nearly 50k tenement houses. Churches and organizations offered relief through social programs and health services. The settlement house movement started in the 1890s with Jane Addams' Hull House, aiming to help working-class women; it later influenced legislation on housing laws, child labor, workers’ compensation, among others. Settlement house residents also impacted women's suffrage and antiwar movements.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European


2. **"Great Migration":** Nearly two million African Americans escaped South between Civil War & Great Depression, primarily to NE & Upper Midwest cities like NY, Chicago, Philly, and St. Louis due to racism, lynchings, & lack of rights + opportunities in the North.
3. **Immigrants:** 
   a. European: Initially NW & Western Europeans moved west seeking land, but later South/Eastern Europeans (Italy, Greece, Slavic countries) arrived due to famine, persecution, or escaping military service, settling in urban centers without funds for western expansion.
   b. African Americans: Mostly found job opportunities in unskilled or semi-skilled positions like steel mills, mines, construction, meat packing, domestic work for women. Earned higher wages than South counterparts and had more housing options.
4. **Ellis Island:** Opened in 1892 as primary port of entry for immigrants to US; inspected health + allowed ~98% entry, denying only 2% due to illness or criminal history.
5. **Discrimination & Legislation**:
   a. Immigration backlash: Newer immigrants (darker skin, foreign languages, religions) became targets of hatred + discrimination when faced with job scarcity or housing issues.
   b. Reverend Josiah Strong's book "Our Country" fueled anti-immigrant sentiment, leading to the American Protective Association (APA).
   c. APA advocated for English literacy test (1917), Chinese Exclusion Act, and laid groundwork for further restrictive legislation like Emergency Quota Act of 1921, Immigration Act of 1924, and National Origins Act.

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life


The **"19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life"** section discusses how various American classes coped with urban life challenges. Machine politics provided solace for working-class citizens, while upper class sought comfort in elite social pursuits. Machine Politics was an efficient but corrupt way to deal with city issues, based on exchange of favors and votes; Tammany Hall being a notable example. Working-class also found escape in popular culture and entertainment, such as amusement parks (Coney Island), vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, and baseball games. The upper class distanced themselves from working-class entertainment, preferring classical music concerts, art collections, and high-society gatherings. Wealthy Americans maintained their status through unique luxuries like trips to Newport or Florida, and by inclusion in the Social Register. Middle class, though not discussed extensively here, found relief in education and suburbanization. 

Key takeaways: Machine Politics for working class, high culture for upper class, and suburban living/higher education for middle class as methods to cope with urban challenges of the time.

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

TAG: New Middle Class
- Emerged in response to urban challenges, different from working class and elite in lifestyle.
- Managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, accountants formed this group.
- Educated and better compensated than working-class poor.
- Escaped city issues through education and suburbanization.
  - Electric railway, Ford's cars enabled transportation to workplaces in cities.
  - Interstate highways, low-interest loans facilitated further suburban growth.

TAG: Middle Class Women Roles
- Pride in maintaining a positive home environment for family, reinforced professional roles.
- Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping gained popularity.
- Embraced gender separation of spheres: men earned while women managed home and kids' needs.
- Some women went to college, with first women's colleges opening (e.g., Mount Holyoke, Vassar).
- Most still became housewives, but education offered opportunities outside the home.
  - Teaching, settlement houses were common paths for educated women.

TAG: Education & Middle Class
- Children didn't need to work early, leading to more educational and career advancement.
- Public school enrollment tripled from 7M in 1870 to 21M in 1920.
- Larger schools hired discipline-specific teachers, high schools increased.
- Morrill Acts created land-grant colleges, affordable for middle class.
- Curriculum shifted toward professional preparation (medicine, law, business).

TAG: City Beautiful Movement
- Reformers addressed urban issues in aesthetics, crime, poverty, focusing on quality of life.
- Middle and upper class escaped to suburbs, leaving working poor in squalor.
- Leaders like Olmsted, Burnham championed progressive reforms with City Beautiful.
- Columbian Exposition's "White City" showcased ideal urban planning elements.
  - Larger parks, wider boulevards, suburb expansion as main principles.
- Influenced city development for decades, improving American urban landscapes.

### 19.4 Change Reflected in Thought and Writing

In 19th-century America, rapid changes due to expansion, technology, and big business shaped society significantly. This era witnessed the rise of influential authors reflecting societal shifts through fiction or nonfiction works.

Charles Darwin's theory of evolution caused controversy, while social Darwinism, popularized by Spencer and Sumner, suggested society progressed like a natural organism with some individuals succeeding due to innate traits and adaptability. Critics argued this disregarded equal opportunities.

Pragmatists like James and Dewey took a nuanced approach to evolutionary ideas, focusing on proving the validity of social constructs through experimentation and education as essential tools for societal advancement. This led to the Ashcan School of Art by Bellows, Hopper, and Henri that captured urban realities, and writers such as Crane, Harding Davis, and Twain embraced realism in literature.

Naturalists like Jack London believed nature was the only governing law for humanity, while other critics of modern America, like Bellamy, George, and Veblen, denounced industrialization's effects. Bellamy's "Looking Backward" envisioned a utopian socialist future, inspiring numerous responses; George's "Progress and Poverty" urged equal land ownership; and Veblen critiqued conspicuous consumption in the leisure class.

Notably, influential women and African American writers also emerged during this time of transformation.
