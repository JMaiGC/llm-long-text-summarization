- Sadie Frowne's memory of arriving in the United States and seeing the Statue of Liberty
- A wondrous world of new opportunities fraught with dangers
- Many Americans experienced similar stories of immigrants seeking a better future

**Urbanization and Its Challenges**
- Growth of American cities in the late nineteenth century due to industrialization, urban population growth, and immigration
- Urban challenges: language, class, race, ethnicity, low wages, overcrowded buildings, poor sanitation, widespread disease
- Possible solutions: economic and cultural resources provided by cities

**Explosion in Urban Population Growth**
- Attractions of city life and employment opportunities due to industrialization changes
- Factories could now be located near urban centers, increasing the demand for workers in cities
- Urban population growth led to the development of unique characters based on core industries

**The Keys to Successful Urbanization**
1. Electric lighting: Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb (patented 1879) and Nikola Tesla's AC system transformed how cities lit up, enabling factories to run continuously
2. Communication improvements: The telephone (patented 1876) increased business growth and demand for workers
3. Intracity transportation: Expanding companies sought workers to handle increasing consumer demand
4. Rise of skyscrapers: Electric lighting allowed cities to stay open all the time, leading to urban sprawl and the need for taller buildings

### Intracity Transportation


**Intracity Transportation and its Challenges**
- Before 1880s, omnibuses were primary mode of transportation within cities
- Horses had limitations, leading to horse manure problem and traffic congestion
- Frank Sprague invented electric trolley in 1887, providing smoother and more efficient transport
- As cities grew, trolleys became crowded, leading to introduction of elevated trains (L-trains) like the Elevated Line in New York City
- Subways were introduced in Boston in 1897, followed by other cities

**The Rise of Skyscrapers and Limitations of Space**
- Eastern cities had limited space for growth due to geographic constraints
- Increasing cost of real estate made upward growth attractive and prestigious
- The Home Insurance Building in Chicago became the first skyscraper in 1885, paving way for other cities
- James Otis's electric elevator made taller buildings viable

**Jacob Riis and Urban Poverty Documentation**
- Riis documented living conditions of poor in NYC slums through photographs and writings
- His work led to new legislation curbing abuses in tenements

**Urban Life Challenges**
- Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent in urban centers
- Living conditions for working-class urban dwellers were poor with overcrowding and lack of sanitation
- Sewage pumping systems were introduced to manage waste in cities
- Churches and civic organizations provided relief through social gospel philosophy and community services
- The settlement house movement led by Jane Addams and Lillian Wald offered aid, education, and employment opportunities for the urban poor

**Jane Addams Reflects on the Settlement House Movement**

- The movement aimed to socialize democracy and promote intellectual enjoyment for all regardless of economic position

### 19.2 The African American "Great Migration" and New European


**The African American "Great Migration"**
- Occurred between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the Great Depression
- Nearly two million African Americans fled the rural South to seek new opportunities
- Most traveled to the Northeast and Upper Midwest, with cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Indianapolis being primary destinations
- Push and pull factors influenced this movement: push out of the South due to racial hatred, and pull towards cities for job opportunities, voting rights, etc.
- Racism and lack of formal education relegated African Americans to lower-paying unskilled or semi-skilled occupations
- More than 80% of African American men worked in steel mills, mines, construction, meat packing, railroad industry, while women found jobs in garment industry or laundries, but were often employed as maids and domestic servants

**New European Immigration**
- Waves of new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe came due to push and pull factors similar to African Americans
- Immigrants arrived without education and finances, settling in port towns rather than seeking fortunes in the West
- By 1890, over 80% of New York's population was foreign-born or children of foreign-born parents
- Number of immigrants peaked between 1900 and 1910 when over nine million people arrived in the US
- Ellis Island opened in 1892 as the primary port of entry for European immigrants, where they were inspected for infectious diseases and processed

**Discrimination and Anti-immigration Legislation**
- New immigrants became targets for hatred and discrimination due to their differences in skin tone, languages, religions, etc.
- Blame was placed on immigrants for problems such as unemployment and overcrowded housing
- Reverend Josiah Strong fueled the hatred and discrimination with his bestselling book "Our Country"
- American Protective Association formed to promote legislation curbing immigration, successfully lobbying Congress to adopt an English language literacy test in 1917 and Chinese Exclusion Act
- Emergency Quota Act of 1921, Immigration Act of 1924, and National Origins Act were also influenced by this group's lobbying

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund
