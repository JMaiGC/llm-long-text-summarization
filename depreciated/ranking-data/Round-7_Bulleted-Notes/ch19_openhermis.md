### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

Chapter 19: The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900

Introduction
- Sadie Frowne's memory of arriving in the US reflects the challenges and opportunities of urban life in this period.
- Rapid industrialization and immigration led to urban growth, but also created various problems.

Urbanization and Its Challenges
- Cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, and New York experienced a significant increase in population due to employment opportunities and industrialization.
- Factories moved away from river-based locations thanks to the development of steam engines.
- Low wages and monotonous work were common in urban factories.
- Urban centers developed unique characters based on their core industries, such as Pittsburgh's steel industry or Detroit's automobile industry.
- Rapid expansion led to problems with housing, transportation, communication, and class inequalities exacerbated by race, religion, and ethnicity.

Keys to Successful Urbanization
1. Electric Lighting: Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb transformed urban life, enabling factories to operate 24/7 and increasing the demand for workers.
2. Communication Improvements: The telephone revolutionized communication, allowing instant long-distance contact and supporting business growth.
3. Intracity Transportation: Rapid expansion necessitated improvements in transportation systems to connect growing urban areas effectively.
4. Rise of Skyscrapers: Taller buildings became possible with innovations like the steel frame and electric elevators, enabling greater population density in limited urban spaces.

### Intracity Transportation

**Intracity Transportation**
- Before 1880s, omnibuses were main form of transportation within cities; large, horse-drawn carriages on tracks for smoother rides
- Electric trolleys introduced by Frank Sprague in 1887, powered by electricity instead of horses, could operate day and night like factories
- Cable cars introduced in San Francisco in 1873 using pulley technology from mining industry to navigate hills
- As cities grew, trolleys became inefficient due to crowds; elevated tracks (L-trains) built over streets to avoid congestion, starting with New York City in 1868
- Subways later developed as underground transportation systems, e.g., Boston's subway system began operating in 1897

**The Rise of Skyscrapers**
- Limitations for space led to upward growth due to increased cost of real estate and prestige associated with tall buildings
- Steel construction techniques enabled builders to go higher, but required invention of elevators (e.g., Otis Elevator Company's electric elevator in 1889) for taller buildings to be viable

**Jacob Riis and "How the Other Half Lives"**
- Danish immigrant Jacob Riis documented conditions of New York City slums as a police reporter, revealing squalor and living conditions of working poor
- His photographs shocked public, leading to legislation curbing abuses in tenements

**Immediate Challenges of Urban Life**
- Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease prevalent in all urban centers; city planners sought new solutions for rapid urban growth
- Living conditions for working-class dwellers poor, with crowded tenement houses, inadequate ventilation, and substandard sanitation leading to spread of diseases like typhoid and cholera
- New York City considered most densely populated city worldwide during late 1800s

**Relief Efforts for Working Class**
- Churches implemented social gospel philosophy, encouraging Christians to improve secular life and work together for better society
- Settlement house movement led by women like Jane Addams (Hull House) and Lillian Wald (Henry Street Settlement) provided aid through facilities offering childcare, evening classes, libraries, gym access, and healthcare
- Success of settlement houses influenced political agenda leading to housing laws, child labor laws, worker's compensation laws, etc.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

The African American “Great Migration” and New European+ Immigration: 
- Factors prompting African American and European immigration to American cities in late nineteenth century 
- Discrimination and anti-immigration legislation faced by immigrants in late nineteenth century 
- Two main groups involved in urbanization movement: African Americans fleeing racism in the South, and southern/eastern European immigrants 

The African American “Great Migration” (1865-1930): 
- Nearly two million African Americans fled rural South for opportunities elsewhere 
- Most traveled to Northeast and Upper Midwest cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia 
- Combination of push and pull factors influenced movement 
- Higher wages, job opportunities, voting rights, and escape from violence attracted African Americans 
- Racism and lack of education limited them to lower-paying jobs in industries like steel mills, mines, construction 

New European+ Immigration: 
- Waves of immigrants from northern/western Europe well off, moved west for land; southern/eastern Europeans lacked funds, settled in cities 
- Pushed by famines, persecution, or military service; pulled by wage-earning jobs 
- By 1890, over 80% of New York population foreign-born or children of foreign-born parents 
- Ellis Island opened in 1892 as primary port of entry for European immigrants 
- Roughly 2% of arriving immigrants denied entry due to medical conditions or criminal history 
- Dillingham Commission confirmed ethnic identification and discrimination against new immigrants 
- Discrimination led to backlash, anti-immigration legislation, and National Origins Act

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

Section 19.3: Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

- Identify how each class of Americans responded to the challenges associated with urban life
	* working class: machine politics, popular culture and entertainment (amusement parks, vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, professional baseball)
	* upper class: refined pastimes (classical music concerts, fine art collections, social gatherings), vacations, exclusive clubs and events
	* middle class: higher education opportunities, suburbanization, focus on individual success through business ventures and social mobility
- Explain the process of machine politics and how it brought relief to working-class Americans
	* machine politics was a process where every citizen could rely on their alderman for solutions to immediate problems (sanitation, sidewalks) in exchange for votes
	* favors were exchanged for votes, votes for timely solutions, with kickbacks going to the "boss"
	* Tammany Hall in New York was an example of a machine political system that ran city politics from the 1850s to the 1930s
- Popular culture and entertainment provided relief to working-class Americans
	* amusement parks (Coney Island, Pittsburgh), vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, professional baseball games, prize-fighting, college football
- Upper-class Americans sought relief in refined pastimes, vacations, exclusive clubs, and events
	* classical music concerts at Carnegie Hall, fine art collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, social gatherings, Newport vacations, Florida winters, European steamship trips
- Middle-class Americans found relief in higher education opportunities, suburbanization, and focus on individual success

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

A New Middle Class:
- Emerged due to education and suburbanization
- Included managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, accountants, etc.
- Better educated and compensated than working-class poor
- Escaped urban challenges through education and physical relocation to suburbs
- Suburbs connected to urban centers via transportation improvements (electric railway)
- Henry Ford's affordable cars allowed more families to consider suburban life
- Interstate highway system and federal low-interest loans further fueled suburban phenomenon

New Roles for Middle-Class Women:
- Pride in creating a positive home environment for family members
- Magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping gained popularity
- Division of gendered spheres: husband earned money, wife managed domestic chores
- Some women gained access to higher education through men's colleges or women's colleges (e.g., Mount Holyoke, Vassar)
- Education opportunities led to teaching, professorial, and settlement house careers

Education and the Middle Class:
- Professional class children did not need to work, enabling more education and advancement
- Public school enrollment tripled from 1870 to 1920 with better schools and specialized instructors
- High schools grew from 100 in 1860 to over 6,000 by 1900
- Morrill Acts created affordable land-grant colleges focused on professions and trades
- College curricula shifted towards preparing students for modern work world

"City Beautiful":
- Reform movement focused on improving urban quality of life (aesthetics, crime, poverty)
- Middle-and upper-class progressive reforms led by Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham
- Influenced city planning with larger parks, wide boulevards, and suburbs
- Columbian Exposition's "White City" showcased perfect city planning concepts

### 19.4 Change Reflected in Thought and Writing

Section 19.4: Change Reflected in Thought and Writing

By the end of this section, readers will be able to:
- Explain how American writers, both fiction and nonfiction, helped Americans better understand changes they faced in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
- Identify some influential women and African American writers of the era

In the late nineteenth century, Americans experienced rapid change due to western expansion, new technologies, and big business. This time of transformation led to the emergence of notable authors who offered a lens through which to understand shifts in American society.

Key Ideas and Thinkers:
1. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution: Darwin argued that species evolved through natural selection, not divine intervention. His ideas were met with controversy but became widely accepted by scientists. Herbert Spencer took Darwin's ideas further, coining "survival of the fittest" and popularizing social Darwinism, which posited that society evolved like a natural organism, with some individuals succeeding due to inherent traits and adaptability.
2. Pragmatism: William James, an influential philosopher, advocated for experimentation in different ideas and perspectives to find truth about American society. He believed ideas must be tied to actual objects and occurrences to identify coherent truths. His work influenced avant-garde and modernist movements in literature and art.
3. Instrumentalism: John Dewey built upon pragmatism, advocating for education as a tool for finding truth and reforming American society. He encouraged educational reforms to create an informed citizenry that could drive needed progressive changes.
4. Realism in literature and visual arts: Authors such as Stephen Crane, Rebecca Harding Davis, and Mark Twain, and artists like George Bellows, Edward Hopper, and Robert Henri embraced realism, portraying scenes from real life to depict the urban lifestyle at the turn of the century.
5. Naturalism: Jack London's works focused on laws of nature governing humanity, while Kate Chopin wrote about social issues in her novel "The Awakening."

Critics of Modern America:
1. Edward Bellamy, Henry George, and Thorstein Veblen were influential critics of the industrial age. Bellamy's utopian novel "Looking Backward" predicted future advancements but criticized capitalist models. His work inspired socialism as an alternative to exploitative industrial capitalist models.
2. Henry George's "Progress and Poverty" argued for equal access to land and natural resources, suggesting a "single land tax" to disincentivize private land ownership. This idea influenced economic progressive reformers and inspired the game Monopoly.
3. Thorstein Veblen lamented capitalism creating a middle class preoccupied with consumption rather than production. He coined "conspicuous consumption," describing how one class exploited workers to fuel their consumption habits, creating inefficiencies and deepening income divides.
