### How are internalized relationships related toe he fourth chakra?

Seconds: 01

> Internalized relationships form archetypal components of our psyche. Our relationship to our mother comes to represent more than how we feel about Mom, it affects how we understand the archetypal symbol of Mother as well as the feminine in general. If our mother mistreated us, our internal relationship to the feminine and all it represents will be impaired. In honoring our individuality, we honor the subtle relationships within ourselves. Our feelings are brought into relationship with our belief systems; our vulnerable child forms an alliance with our responsible adult; our inner masculine makes love with the inner feminine. Our inner critic, rather than permeating every thought, becomes realistically related to our self-protection. In the fourth chakra we no longer see the world entirely in terms of our own needs, and so our relationships expand from being specifically one-on-one (i.e., child and mother, child and father) to include larger family and social structures. The child now finds that she is part of Mommy and Daddy's relationship with each other, and that she has brothers and sisters, classmates, neighbors, and friends of her own. The verbal messages that were internalized during the third chakra stage centered around action and behavior. Now in the fourth chakra stage it is the parent-child relationship itself that becomes important. If the message was given in the context of fear, we feel fear along with the internalized message."
