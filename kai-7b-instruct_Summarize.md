> The fourth chakra, also known as the heart chakra, is located in the chest and heart area. It is associated with the element of air and named Anahata, which means \"unstruck\" or \"unbroken.\" The purpose of this chakra is to balance love and relationships, including intimacy, self-love, devotion, and anima/animus integration. However, issues such as grief, rejection, abandonment, loss, shaming, constant criticism, abuse, betrayal, loneliness, isolation, depression, fear of intimacy, fear of relationships, lack of empathy, narcissism, codependency, poor boundaries, demanding, clinging, and jealousy can disrupt the balance of this chakra. To heal this chakra, one can practice breathing exercises, pranayama, work with arms, reaching out, taking in, journaling, self-discovery, psychotherapy, examine assumptions about relationships, emotional release of grief, forgiveness when appropriate, inner child work, and codependency work. Affirmations such as \"I am worthy of love,\" \"I am loving to myself and others,\" and \"There is an infinite supply of love\" can also help balance this chakra.

> The text discusses the importance of love and its role in our lives. It explains how love is a basic right that is often damaged, diminished, or wounded. The author argues that love is elusive because it is so simple, and literature abounds with sagas of love and its loss. The text also discusses the concept of healthy love and how it is important to create it in our lives. It highlights the negative effects of child abuse and how it can be a travesty of love. The author argues that political agendas cut funds for the downtrodden and needy, while the defense budget soars. They also discuss the myths that shape our cultural history and how they influence our relationships with others. The text emphasizes the importance of self-reflection, self-acceptance, relationship intimacy, and devotion in balancing love.

> The passage discusses the heart chakra in the context of the chakra system. The heart chakra is located at the center of the Rainbow Bridge, where two currents come to perfect balance. This chakra deals with balance, love, and relationships. When we fall in love, our defenses are stripped away, and we are lifted into an enlarged view of the world. Love expands our horizons and brings us into a deeper connection with ourselves. Intimacy is the foundation for self-expression, as only through self-acceptance can we come fully into our truth and have the courage to express it. The loss of love produces profound despair and forces us to confront and heal our pain in order to go on.

> The heart chakra in ancient tantric diagrams is depicted as a lotus with twelve petals containing a six-pointed star made of two interlacing triangles, representing the downward movement of spirit into matter and the upward liberation of matter into spirit, meeting in perfect balance in the heart. Balance is an essential principle at the heart chakra level of integration, which implies both internal balance between various aspects of ourselves and external balance with the world around us. Finding this equilibrium supports healthy and long-lasting love relationships. The concept of balance will be examined in two essential kinds of relationships: those with ourselves and those created with others.

Seconds: 03
> Intimacy involves being intimate with oneself and then extending that intimacy to others. In order to have intimacy, one must first have a sense of self and be able to love themselves. Without self-love, it is difficult to maintain balance in relationships and treat others with respect. Self-love is an act of treating oneself with respect, compassion, and understanding, just as one would treat someone else they love. Our relationships with others reflect our relationship with ourselves, and self-love is the foundation for loving others.

> The author Thomas Moore discusses the concept of self-reflective consciousness, which he believes is the basis of all relationship. He argues that many people come to therapy because they are not aware of their true selves and that this lack of awareness is due to a missing beholding of Self. According to Moore, beholding is the process of simply witnessing oneself without judgment or change, and it establishes a sacred relationship with oneself. He believes that self-examination is essential for evolving and rising from a state of integration and peace characteristic of the fourth chakra. Without examining what has been, we are destined to repeat it, and without cultivating consciousness, our ascending current has to turn around and go back down to the base before it reaches its full expansion. Moore argues that self-examination gives birth to a new integrated Self that is no longer bound by the past but energized by the will beneath it and headed toward the future.

> The passage discusses the concept of love being a somatic reality or a bodied truth. It also highlights the importance of balance in the heart chakra between mind and body. This balance is achieved through learning to listen to the body's subtle communications, which can lead to recovering memories, working through traumas, releasing stored tensions, and completing unresolved emotional transactions. The process of self-reflection allows the mind to connect various parts of our experience, such as feelings with mental images, impulses with belief systems, and sensation with meaning. By integrating this awareness into higher levels of complexity and understanding, we can fully embrace our experience in the body.

> The Anima and Animus are archetypal energies of the inner feminine and masculine respectively. They are believed to be more prominent in men and women respectively but both genders carry each archetype. These archetypes exist externally as symbols in the collective consciousness, often becoming stereotypes. Stereotypes are culturally determined versions of the original archetype, emphasizing only a part of the archetype behind them. If our images of masculine and feminine become strongly polarized, it is likely that either our anima or animus will be repressed. This can lead to projecting these archetypes onto others, often in idealized states, wreaking havoc on our intimate relationships. The resolution of the anima and animus represents the internal sacred marriage, or hieros gamos, the balancing of masculine and feminine energies within. This alchemical marriage is another step in the individuation process that leads toward wholeness.

> Pierre Teilhard de Chardin believed that love could unite living beings and complete them. He suggested that if love can achieve this on a small scale, it should be able to do so on a larger scale as well. In relationships with others, balance is crucial for success. If one partner is too distant while the other feels suffocated, or if there are unequal financial earnings or sexual desires, the relationship may struggle. It's important to consider what is out of balance in your own relationship and work towards finding an equitable balance. Nature also seeks balance, and a lack of balance can lead to pressure, frustration, stress, resentment, and an erosion of openness and goodwill. Balance is not static but rather a constantly shifting homeostasis that requires give-and-take over time.

Seconds: 04
> The fourth chakra is associated with reaching out and taking in, and fear and grief can block this process. If the heart chakra is blocked, it can lead to problems with the arms and chest. Reaching may have become blocked due to past fruitless attempts. In relationships, one movement may be more prevalent than the other, and body language can indicate the dynamics of the relationship. It is important to focus on the sweetness of love rather than fear, and to practice pulling one's lover in while holding one's own ground.

> Thomas Moore's book Soul Mates discusses the struggle between the soul's need for attachment and the spirit's need for freedom in relationships. This struggle is enacted through the simultaneous longing and fear of commitment, and it is a major theme in most relationships. In the heart chakra, we seek to balance the lower chakras' pull for security with the upper chakras' pull toward novelty. When our partner constricts us, we get restless and want to push away. The spirit hates constriction and limitation, while the soul finds security in familiarity and permanence. A healthy relationship needs to honor both the upward and downward movements of energy and create a balance between spirit and soul, expansion and constriction, freedom and commitment. Moore states that many people seem to live the pain of togetherness and fantasize the joys of separateness, and this can be a frustrating, endless struggle that never bears fruit and never settles down. To decide upon one or the other is to further the divorce between the transcendence of the Father and the immanence of the Mother. As children of divorce, we search for refuge in one or the other, ignorant of the dynamic balance that serves both liberation and manifestation. The more we allow one kind of energy, the more the other can come through. Once a commitment is made, it is easier to allow a partner their solitude or freedom. Conversely, the more a partner insists on one aspect, the more his lover will yearn for its opposite. Dynamic balance is a dance between attachment and freedom.

> The concept of Eros and Thanatos refers to the dynamic between the force of life and the force of death in relationships. Eros is associated with love, beauty, and merging, while Thanatos is associated with grief, sorrow, and separation. According to Rollo May, it is the unconscious patterns and behaviors that sabotage relationships and bring about the end of a relationship. However, coming together and pulling apart are two inseparable steps in a single dance, and those who honor the separation and distancing as part of the growth of relationships can renew the dance of Eros. It is important to be aware of our own need for separateness and our partner's fear of engulfment, as these are not statements about us but Thanatos's needs to balance the relationship.

Seconds: 05
> The text describes grief as a demon that sits on the heart chakra and causes us to feel heavy, numb, and cold when it is denied. When we acknowledge and express our grief, however, it leads to hope, spaciousness, and a sense of aliveness. The author also discusses the grief that occurs at the end of a relationship, which can be easy to understand but sometimes carries deeper wounds. Susan's case illustrates how grief can stem from unfulfilled needs for authenticity and independence, leading to depression and a constricted chest. The text suggests that compassion is the healer for grief, allowing us to open our hearts and connect with others in a more meaningful way.

Seconds: 02
> Compassion means having passion with and understanding another's needs. It is an exquisite balance of upper and lower chakra expression that centers yet opens space for change. Buddhahood can be attained through deep compassion. When we cannot solve a problem, offering compassion is still important.

Seconds: 05
> Devotion is a spiritual act of egoless surrender that occurs when we consciously surrender ourselves to a greater force beyond ourselves. It can be practiced through devotional service to a deity or teacher, or towards the beloved, within a family, or to a political cause or project. When we become parents, we experience selfless devotion to the newborn child as we transcend our perceived limitations. Devotion expands the binding of the spirit by lifting us beyond ourselves, but it can also deplete the ego-centered third chakra if we are not consciously connected to the Self within. If the object of our worship should leave, fall from grace, or reject us, we may be devastated, but healing comes from reconnecting responsibly to the self within and seeing it as an aspect of divinity in its own right.

> The passage discusses the devastating effects of lack of love and abuse on individuals, particularly children. It highlights how abuses traumatize the heart chakra, which is responsible for integrating and healing. Abuses that occur within family relationships are especially damaging as they distort the relationship and cause individuals to shut down their hearts and pull back into themselves. The passage also discusses how a lack of energy in relationships can be caused by an underdeveloped capacity to be relational, which impairs one's sense of how things connect and prevents individuals from rising into a larger sense of their own being. Finally, the passage emphasizes the importance of attending to superficial needs but also providing specific attention and touch to children in order to build a foundation for dependent love.

Seconds: 02
> Abusive relationships teach a form of love, but abuse itself is the antithesis of love. It undermines the natural developmental process and interferes with the internal wiring of the physical, emotional, and psychic system. Abuse causes feelings of defectiveness and makes life feel like a painful experience to be endured rather than loved.

Seconds: 03
> The loss of self-love can occur when we identify with our caretakers and their values, leading to feelings of unlovability and defectiveness. This can cause us to abandon ourselves and become an object to ourselves, even an object of contempt. Without relationship to the self, reflective consciousness is impossible, leading to a loss of ground and loneliness. When we give everything to others, we are bankrupting ourselves and lack a center to which others can be attracted. This can lead to feelings of abandonment and loss when the other person leaves.

Seconds: 08
> The text describes how internalized relationships form archetypal components of our psyche. Our relationship with our mother or father can affect our understanding of the feminine or masculine archetypes and our expectations for future relationships. If our parents mistreated us, we may have an impaired relationship with these archetypes and project this onto others. This can lead to a messy relationship dynamic where both partners are relating from their wounds and defenses rather than their wholeness. The text calls this internalized relationship an \"imago,\" which is a composite picture of the people who have influenced us most strongly at an early age. It programs our reactions, defenses, behaviors, and interpretations of events and becomes part of our character armor and personality. Our current relationships provide the training ground for unraveling these primary relationships and creating new and productive relationships. The heart chakra is about bonding, and unintegrated parts of ourselves that are not bonded into the heart with love will seek bonding elsewhere. However, bonding patterns can be oppressive and trap us in negative dynamics. To break these patterns, we must become conscious of our internal relationships and listen, discover, and honor the many aspects of our inner complexity.

Seconds: 04
> The article discusses how children who experience abusive relationships with their parents may have a skewed perception of love. They may deny the effects of abuse or convince themselves that they deserve it, equating love with pain and mistreatment. This acceptance can impact the heart chakra and upper three chakras, affecting our ability to speak our truth, see clearly, and question in general. In adult relationships, we may be blind to abuse from our partner due to the fantasy bond, an illusion that keeps us believing that our partner really does love us despite evidence to the contrary. We make excuses for their behavior and continue to accept what would normally be unacceptable.

> Rejection is a universal experience that causes deep emotional pain and wounds the human heart. It leads to feelings of helplessness, low self-esteem, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. Rejection triggers an infantile state of helplessness in adults, which can lead to negative self-identification and self-rejection. Some people may become angry instead of sad when rejected, but it is important to differentiate between overidentification with the lover and truths that need to be learned. Compassion is needed to reconnect with the core self and stop identifying with the person who has betrayed or devalued us.

> The character structure of Henry is a Rigid or Achiever. He is a highly successful CEO in a large company with well-toned muscles and erect posture. His body radiates vitality and readiness, but his energy is without depth as if caught in a loop. He has had a long string of relationships as many women have fallen in love with him, but he always grows bored and moves on. Henry’s heart is blocked due to parental rejection during his fourth chakra developmental period. His father expected him to grow up and chided him for his immature need for love and security. He was no longer allowed to climb on their laps, ask for hugs, or cry when he was sad. Henry remembers that on his first day in kindergarten, he was afraid to get on the school bus. He cried and clung to his mother and later that night he was deeply scorned for his childish behavior. He was told that he was too old for that sort of thing and that it would not be tolerated. In order to stop the ow of such feelings, he sti ened his body and restricted his breath. His father, also an ambitious career man, had such high expectations for him that Henry never felt like he was good enough. In high school, he was a football star and honor roll student. He had fantasies of becoming a great scientist and nally winning his father’s approval. His father, however, was still distant, focused on his own work, and paid attention to Henry only long enough to tell him how he could have done better. His mother stood by silently and supported her husband in this behavior while she poured tenderness on his younger sister. No matter what Henry did, his authentic self was rejected. Each time he tried to win approval, his heart was broken. Forced to rise above his need for love, he channeled his aggressive energy into achievement, unconsciously hoping it would win the love and recognition he craved. But his heart had long ago been forced to close down, and even when love was forthcoming, as it often was from women, he was unable to experience the satisfaction of being enough. In fact, love given in admiration increases the feeling that there is no love for the authentic, vulnerable self. This does not bring real satisfaction or healing and so the rigid character restlessly moves on. At the developmental period when Henry’s heart would be most open and

> The article discusses the concept of excess and deficiency in the heart chakra. Excessive love is a problem when it becomes an obsession, where the loved one is more an extension of ourselves than a separate being. Jealousy is a product of this obsession. On the other hand, deficient love can result in shutting down and avoiding risks. The de cient heart chakra responds to wounds by withdrawing and becoming conditional. It plays a game of coldness, as if the withdrawal of love can manipulate someone into loving us more. The article suggests that it is important to examine our basic stance in life and bring it into balance whenever possible.

Seconds: 05
> The text describes love as a powerful force that heals wounds and bridges gaps in the universe. However, due to past experiences, individuals may struggle with understanding how to apply love to their own wounds and those of others. The text suggests that self-acceptance is crucial for loving oneself and others, as it allows individuals to honor their individuality and form relationships with their various subpersonalities. The text also emphasizes the importance of reclaiming rejected selves or the shadow through reflection and integration, which leads to greater complexity, maturity, and creativity. Overall, the text provides practical suggestions for applying love to heal wounds and bridge gaps in one's own life and in the world around us.

After that, the frequency of success in getting what they want is evaluated, as well as the realism of their desires. Finally, steps can be taken to bring these parts into wholeness. The exercise also involves looking at relationships between different parts and creating a dialog between them to resolve any issues.

> The passage discusses how feelings are important for our emotional well-being, but when they are hurt, we may close down and restrict our breath, which can lead to deadening ourselves. To access and mobilize repressed feelings, it is recommended to do breath work with a trusted friend or therapist, or practice yoga exercises called pranayama that help open the chest and charge the body with vital energy.

> The article describes a technique for observing and working with the breath to open the heart. The first step is to become aware of one's own breathing and have someone else watch and give feedback on any holding or constrictions. The second step involves reaching out and taking in with the breath, using slow and conscious movements to pull the arms forward with each exhale and inhale. This exercise encourages awareness of blocked feelings and helps to open up the heart chakra. The third step involves standing over the partner and offering resistance as they reach out and take in with the breath, which can help to release blocked feelings and increase energy flow through the arms.

> Grief is a natural response to loss and can restrict one's breath. Deepening the breath often releases grief. Grief is typically based on loss, especially of loved ones, and can lead to the loss of vital pieces of oneself. The point of grief work is to regain connection with the self inside rather than increase attachment to what was lost. It involves reclaiming the part of oneself that was attached to what was lost and nurturing and regaining that part once again. Grief work helps clean wounds from previous hurts and leads to the pony in the stable, which represents hope and wholeness.

> The text describes the concept of forgiveness as a way to heal the heart after it has been injured. It explains that when we hold onto anger and blame, we prevent ourselves from receiving and healing. The author suggests that forgiveness is the ultimate step in healing, and that it allows the heart to lighten and move on. The text also discusses the importance of forgiving oneself, as well as others, and provides steps for how to do so. It emphasizes that forgiveness is an organic process that cannot be forced against its own time, but can be encouraged. Finally, the text discusses the concept of love as a verb, and encourages readers to actively create love in their lives through daily conscious commitment to behaving in a loving and caring fashion towards themselves and others."
