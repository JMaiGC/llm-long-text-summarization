TEXT: ```i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal``` [/INST]

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

**Empathizing vs Encouraging**

* Empathizing is the act of understanding and sharing the feelings of another person. It involves actively listening and trying to understand their perspective.
* Encouraging, on the other hand, is the act of motivating or supporting someone to take action or achieve a goal. It can involve providing advice, guidance, or encouragement.
* In the context of someone who is suffering, empathizing can be subtle and may involve simply being there for them without actively trying to fix their problems. However, if the person has been talking about their past for a long time and it's not leading to healing, it may be necessary to interrupt and bring the conversation to the present moment.

**Healing through Talking About the Present**

* Healing from trauma or difficult experiences often involves processing what has happened in the past. However, simply talking about the past can also perpetuate the cycle of suffering if it doesn't lead to healing.
* To promote healing, it's important to focus on what is happening in the present moment and how it is being stimulated by the past. This involves connecting with the person on a deeper level and helping them see how their experiences have shaped them and how they can use that understanding to move forward.

**Interrupting to Bring Conversation to Life**

* If someone has been talking about their past for a long time and it's not leading to healing, it may be necessary to interrupt and bring the conversation to the present moment. This can involve acknowledging the person's feelings and helping them see how they are still feeling hurt or upset because of an unmet need for respect.
* By interrupting and bringing the conversation to the present moment, it becomes possible to connect with the person on a deeper level and help them heal from their experiences. This can involve asking questions about what is happening in the present moment and how it is being stimulated by the past.

**Last Question and Next Topic**

* After discussing the importance of empathizing vs encouraging and healing through talking about the present, the speaker moves on to their next topic before the end of the conversation.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 

Notes:

* The speaker discusses the idea that emotional pain can be caused by external stimuli, but ultimately, our emotional reactions are determined by how we choose to deal with those stimuli.
* The speaker uses examples from their work in Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone to illustrate this point. They work with people who have experienced trauma and loss, and the way they cope with their emotions varies depending on their individual experiences and perspectives.
* The speaker also discusses the idea of accountability and responsibility. They believe that the person responsible for causing harm is ultimately responsible for their actions, but that the victim is also responsible for how they choose to deal with those actions.
* The speaker emphasizes the importance of empathy in helping children cope with trauma and loss. They believe that it is essential to give a child all the empathy they need before teaching them about responsibility and accountability.
* The speaker concludes by stating that emotional pain can be both created and alleviated through our choices and perspectives, and that empathy is crucial in helping individuals cope with trauma and loss.

**Summary of Text:**

* The concept of \"deserve\" is a dangerous and violent idea that implies that one must deserve appreciation and punishment based on their behavior.
* Gratitude can be scary to receive because it challenges our negative self-image and forces us to confront our own power to make life wonderful.
* It's important to express gratitude sincerely and from the heart, rather than as a means of praising or rewarding someone.
* The idea that our light (our positive qualities) scares us more than our darkness (our negative qualities) is beautifully written in \"The Course of Miracles.\"
* It's important to recognize our own power to make life wonderful and to celebrate this power rather than criticizing ourselves.
