### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

**19.1 Urbanization and Its Challenges**
- Rapid urbanization in the second half of the 19th century due to new technologies, industrialization, immigration, and problems such as famine or religious persecution.
- The development of steam engines allowed factories to be located near cities rather than relying on rivers for water power.
- Cities grew in population, employment opportunities expanded but wages were often low and work was monotonous.
- Urbanization brought challenges: housing, transportation, communication, class inequality, racial divisions, religious differences, ethnic strife, and corrupt politics.

**The Keys to Successful Urbanization (1870s-1900)**
- 1. Electric Lighting: Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb and Nikola Tesla's AC system allowed extended power supply and round-the-clock factory operations.
- 2. Communication Improvements: The telephone replaced the telegraph and contributed to urban sprawl, increasing business efficiency and consumer demand.
- 3. Intracity Transportation: Expansion of transportation networks was critical for managing increased populations and facilitating economic growth.
- 4. Rise of Skyscrapers: Taller buildings enabled more people to live in limited urban space.

**Urbanization Challenges**
- Basic urban infrastructure problems included transportation, adequate housing, communication, electricity, water supply, and sanitation.
- Electric lighting allowed factories to operate 24/7, increasing production but also demand for workers.
- Telephones contributed to business growth by allowing rapid communication and instant orders.

### Intracity Transportation

**Intracity Transportation**: As cities grew and expanded, efficient travel within them became a challenge. Most infrastructure was focused on connecting cities rather than facilitating intracity travel. Before the 1880s, the most common form of transportation in cities was omnibuses - large horse-drawn carriages that worked adequately in smaller, less congested cities but struggled in larger urban areas with crowded streets and pollution issues.

**Electric Trolleys**: In 1887, Frank Sprague invented the electric trolley, which was a more efficient alternative to horse-drawn omnibuses. The electric trolley worked along similar concepts as omnibuses but used electricity instead of horses. Electric trolleys could operate throughout the day and night, making them better suited for factories and workers' schedules. They were also adopted in less industrialized cities like Richmond, Virginia.

**Elevated Trains (L-Trains)**: As larger cities like Chicago and New York experienced increasing traffic congestion, trolleys became less efficient. To tackle this problem, city planners elevated the trolley lines above streets, creating elevated trains or L-trains. The first elevated train system was established in New York City as early as 1868 and spread to other cities such as Boston (in 1887) and Chicago (in 1892).

**Subways**: As skyscrapers began to dominate urban landscapes, underground transportation became necessary. The first subway system in the United States opened in Boston in 1897, followed by New York City and other major cities.

**The Rise of Skyscrapers**: Cities faced a challenge in providing enough space for growing populations. In Eastern cities, land expansion was limited due to geographic constraints and existing settlements. This led to upward growth with skyscrapers becoming more common as they offered prestige and additional real estate options. The Home Insurance Building in Chicago (1885) was the first ten-story skyscraper, but it was not until 1889 that the Otis Elevator Company installed the first electric elevator, making taller buildings viable.

**Jacob Riis and "How the Other Half Lives"**: Jacob Riis, a Danish immigrant who moved to New York in the late 19th century, documented the living conditions of the city's working poor through his writings and photographs. He was appalled by the squalor he encountered and sought reforms against immoral landlords and laws that contributed to dangerous living conditions and high rents. His work helped shape public opinion and led to new legislation addressing tenement issues.

**The Immediate Challenges of Urban Life**: Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent problems in all cities. Living conditions for working-class urban dwellers were atrocious, with overcrowded tenements and poor sanitation. This led to the spread of diseases like typhoid and cholera. By 1889, New York City, Baltimore, Chicago, and New Orleans had introduced sewage pumping systems to combat waste management issues. Cities were also prone to fires due to cramped living conditions.

**Churches and Civic Organizations**: Churches sought to help the urban poor by providing services like gymnasiums, libraries, evening classes on hygiene and healthcare. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) expanded their reach in American cities during this time. The settlement house movement of the 1890s provided additional relief with women like Jane Addams and Lillian Wald leading the way. These settlement houses offered assistance to working-class women, including childcare, evening classes, libraries, gym facilities, and free healthcare.

**Florence Kelley**: Florence Kelley worked alongside Addams and Wald in advocating for housing laws, child labor laws, and worker's compensation laws. She co-founded the National Child Labor Committee and played a role in establishing the Children's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Labor in 1912.

**Jane Addams**: Jane Addams was a social activist who founded Hull House, an influential settlement house in Chicago that became a model for other cities. She was active in the women's suffrage movement and advocated for international peace efforts. Her work earned her the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

THE AFRICAN AMERICAN “GREAT MIGRATION”
- Between Civil War to Great Depression, almost two million African Americans moved for new opportunities
- Most traveled to the Northeast and Upper Midwest, with eight main cities (New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Indianapolis) accounting for over two-thirds of migrants
- Push factors: racism in South, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth Amendments not enough to stop violence and discrimination
- Pull factors: job opportunities, higher wages, potential for voting rights (men), assistance from businesses
- African American workers often took unskilled/semi-skilled jobs (steel mills, mines, construction, meat packing)
- Women worked in garment industry, laundries or as domestic servants, with limited opportunities

NEW EUROPEAN IMMIGRATION
- Waves of immigrants from northern and western Europe well off, moved west to purchase land; newer southern/eastern European immigrants had less funds, settled in urban centers
- Push factors: famines, persecution, compulsory military service (similar to African Americans)
- Pull factors: wage-earning work
- Arrived without education/funds, settled more readily in port towns
- By 1890, over 80% of New York population foreign-born or children of foreign-born parentage
- Ellis Island opened in 1892 for immigration processing; 9 million people arrived between 1900 and 1910

IMMIGRANT DISCRIMINATION AND LEGISLATION
- New immigrants (African Americans, southern/eastern Europeans) easily identifiable due to skin tone, language, religion, food preferences, etc.
- Immigrants blamed for problems; backlash led to anti-immigrant groups like the American Protective Association
- Lobbied for legislation such as English literacy test (1917), Chinese Exclusion Act, Emergency Quota Act of 1921, Immigration Act of 1924, National Origins Act <|im_end|>

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

**19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life:**

- Understanding how each class of Americans responded to urban life challenges
- Machine politics and its relief for working-class citizens
- Settlement houses, religious and civic organizations supporting working-class people
- The upper class's pursuit of luxury and comfort in urban settings

**Working Class:**

- Relief through machine politics:
	- Favors exchanged for votes
	- Quick solutions to immediate problems
	- Example: Tammany Hall in New York
- Relief through popular culture and entertainment:
	- Amusement parks (e.g., Coney Island)
	- Vaudeville shows
	- Nickelodeon theaters as predecessors of movie theaters
	- Professional baseball
	- Prize-fighting and college football

**Upper Class:**

- Seeking more refined pastimes:
	- Classical music concerts
	- Fine art collections (e.g., Metropolitan Museum of Art)
	- Social gatherings with peers
- Distinguishing themselves through luxurious activities:
	- Vacations in Newport, Rhode Island
	- Winter relocation to Florida
	- Frequent trips aboard steamships to Europe
- The importance of the annual Social Register (or Blue Book) in validating their social status.

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

New Middle Class:
- Emerged in cities as managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, accountants, etc.
- Improved education and suburbanization were solutions to urban challenges.
- Suburbs provided an escape from city chaos with the development of transportation like electric railways and cars.
- Middle-class women focused on maintaining a home environment while some pursued higher education in women's colleges.
- Education opportunities for children helped secure their middle-class status.

City Beautiful Movement:
- Led by Frederick Law Olmsted, Daniel Burnham, and others to improve city life and create middle-class-dominated urban spaces.
- Inspired by the "White City" at Columbian Exposition in 1893.
- Three principal tenets: create larger parks, build wider boulevards, and develop suburbs.
- Shaped American city planning for decades to come.
