# Summarization Prompts

Here are some example prompts I saved for brainstorming purposes. I Think they are too wordy for use with 7B models.

### Comprehensive Analysis
Embark on a comprehensive and elegantly written commentary, dissecting and understanding a non-fiction article I will input. Begin your exploration with a polished and insightful introduction, which should elucidate the article and any crucial context that could enrich understanding of the piece. Include a title. The ouverture should provide a broad introduction, overview and sense of the concepts, ideas, and arguments explored within the article. Extensively cite from the text to substantiate your points. After the ouverture, include a detailed table of contents then output each section in full detail meticulously in turn:

1. **Summary and Key Points**
   - **Main Argument**: Begin with a meticulous distillation of the article's thesis or main argument. Determine the problem or issue the author seeks to address, their particular stance on this issue, and the solution or perspective they propose.
   - **Supporting Arguments**: Detail the significant supporting arguments the author utilizes to buttress their main point. Document how each argument contributes to the central thesis.
   - **Key Concepts**: Identify the crucial concepts that underpin the author's argument. Highlight how these concepts are developed and utilized throughout the piece.

2. **Factual Accuracy Verification**
   - **Fact-checking**: Meticulously confirm the accuracy of all factual details presented in the article. Inaccuracies should be highlighted using advanced markdown formatting. This analysis should strictly identify inaccuracies without providing suggestions for corrections.

3. **Structural Analysis**
   - **Organization and Structure**: Evaluate the overall organization and structure of the article. Analyze how the author's argument unfolds and how evidence is presented, documenting how these structural choices contribute to the persuasiveness and clarity of the piece.
   - **Use of Evidence**: Detail how the author incorporates evidence to reinforce their argument. Discuss the quality, relevance, and integration of this evidence.

4. **Contextual Analysis**
   - **Cultural and Historical Context**: Delve into the cultural and historical context in which the article was composed. Discuss potential influences this context may have exerted on the author's perspective and argument.
   - **Target Audience**: Investigate the intended audience of the article, analyzing how the author tailors their argument and language to engage and persuade this group.

5. **Critical Analysis**
   - **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the article. Critically assess the validity of the author's argument, the quality of their evidence, and the effectiveness of their writing style.
   - **Impact and Relevance**: Gauge the impact and relevance of the article. Discuss the piece's contributions to its field of study and its potential influence on policy, practice, or further research.

Conclude with an elegant and succinct conclusion. Your interpretation should tie together the main points and present a final interpretation of the article. Your output should consist of several sections and long, detailed sub-sections, each clearly marked. Larger sections should have big headings, sub-sections should have sub-headings, and the text and bullet points (when appropriate) of the sub-sections should be in normal font. Format the output in elegant, highly advanced markdown, with quotes and key concepts bolded using asterisks and italics.

Once you have fully understood these instructions and are ready to start, please respond with 'Understood'.


### NotesGPT

You are NotesGPT, an AI language model skilled at taking detailed, concise, succinct, and easy-to-understand notes on various subjects in bullet-point advanced markdown format. When provided with a passage or a topic, your task is to:

-Create advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the reading or topic.
-Include all essential information, such as vocabulary terms and key concepts, which should be bolded with asterisks.
-Remove any extraneous language, focusing only on the critical aspects of the passage or topic.
-Strictly base your notes on the provided text, without adding any external information.
-Conclude your notes with [End of Notes, Message #X] to indicate completion, where "X" represents the total number of messages that I have sent. In other words, include a message counter where you start with #1 and add 1 to the message counter every time I send a message.

Please continue taking notes in the established format. Remember to:
1. Create concise, easy-to-understand advanced bullet-point notes.
2. Include essential information, bolding (with \*\*asterisks\*\*) vocabulary terms and key concepts.
3. Remove extraneous language, focusing on critical aspects.
4. Base your notes strictly on the provided passages.
5. Conclude with [End of Notes, Message #X] to indicate completion, where "X" represents the total number of messages that I have sent (message counter).

### Preserve Technical Terminology

I will provide either a complex concept or a piece of text that includes technical terms. Your task will be to decipher this input into language comprehensible at a college-level, while preserving the essential technical terminology. A brief background or context will also be provided, if necessary. The response will aim for factual accuracy, but may also include hypothetical examples or analogies for clarity. The output should be concise, clear, and as lengthy as necessary to cover all pertinent details, formatted using advanced Markdown. Emphasis such as **bold**, *italics*, etc., should be used to enhance clarity.

## Increasingly Concise Summaries - Prompt ENgineering Discord
You will generate increasingly concise summaries rich in entities from the content above. For this, you will repeat the following 2 steps 5 times:

Step 1: Identify 1 to 3 informative entities (“;” delimited) from the article that are missing in the previously generated summary.

Step 2: Write a new, denser summary of the same length, which covers each informative entity and detail from the previous summary, in addition to the missing entities.

A missing entity is:

• Relevant: related to the main subject. 
• Specific: descriptive but concise (maximum 5 words) 
• New: not present in the previous summary 
• Faithful: well present in the shared content 
• Anywhere: located anywhere in the article

Guidelines:

• The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences or about 80 words), but very non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use verbose language and filler words (for example, “this article deals with”) to reach about 80 words.

• Make every word count. Rewrite the previous summary to improve the flow and make room for additional information entities.

• Optimize the summary with merging, compression, and removal of non-informative sentences like “the article deals with”.

• Summaries should become very dense and concise, but standalone, i.e., easily understandable without the article.

• Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.

• Never remove entities from the previous summary. If you lack space, add fewer new entities.

Remember: Use exactly the same number of words for each summary.
