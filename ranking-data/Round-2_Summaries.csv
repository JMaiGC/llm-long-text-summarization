"FOREWORD. Human beings face unprecedented challenges as we approach the next millennium. We are seeking new ways to meet the demands of modern life as its unrelenting flow of information demands our attention. Although in many ways, we have greater opportunities for a rich and fulfilling life than ever before, it is clear that we need to evolve new strategies if we are to survive and thrive as individuals and as a species. Our Western culture is dynamic, vibrant, and eagerly embraces change. Our enthusiasm for that which is new enables us to cross technological and philosophical boundaries that were unimaginable a century ago. Yet, this fascination with change has extracted a toll on our society. Many people feel uprooted, disconnected from the great traditions that have provided guidance and nourishment to human beings for thousands of years. The ancient Vedic tradition, cognized by the great seers of India, willingly offers us a wealth of practical knowledge on how to live a healthy and meaningful life. Vedic wisdom is timeless and unbounded and, therefore; it is relevant in this modern age. Fortunately, we have Dr. David Frawley to translate and interpret this profound information so it can be transformed into living knowledge for all who ingest it. In his latest book, Ayurveda and the Mind. Dr. Frawley once again shines his brilliant intellectual light to illuminate the practical applications of Ayurveda and Yoga as applied to the mind. Through his clear exposition of the Vedic principles of consciousness and its expressions, a simple, yet profound approach to psychological and emotional healing is elucidated. This book reminds us that the mind is a subtle organ, whose health depends upon its ability to extract nourishment from the environment. If we have accumulated toxicity in the form of emotional wounds, frustrations, disappointments or wrong beliefs, eliminating these impurities from our mental and emotional layers is essential if we are to have true emotional and spiritual freedom. Unlike modern psychological science which has until very recently maintained the dichotomy of mind and body, Ayurvedic psychology clearly recognizes that the mind and the body are one. The mind is a field of ideas, the body is a field of molecules, but both are expressions of consciousness interacting with itself. This book is a valuable resource to students of Ayurveda, Yoga, Tantra and psychology. Dr. Frawley has again demonstrted his unique talent of digesting ancient Vedic knowledge and feeding us this understanding, which nourishes our body, mind and soul. He has been a dear and true teacher to me and I feel great appreciation for the loving wisdom he so readily shares with me and the world.",2732," - Human beings face unprecedented challenges as we approach the next millennium.\n- We need new strategies to survive and thrive as individuals and as a species.\n- Western culture embraces change, but many people feel uprooted and disconnected from traditional guidance.\n- The ancient Vedic tradition offers practical knowledge on how to live a healthy and meaningful life.\n- Dr. David Frawley\'s latest book, Ayurveda and the Mind, illuminates the practical applications of Ayurveda and Yoga as applied to the mind.\n- Ayurvedic psychology recognizes that the mind and body are one, interacting with consciousness.\n- This book is a valuable resource for students of Ayurveda, Yoga, Tantra, and psychology.",710,-74.01171303,3,,"1.

"PREFACE. Ayurveda is the extraordinary mind-body medicine of India with its great yogic spiritual tradition, a tremendous resource for bringing wholeness to all levels of our existence. It is one of the world\'s oldest and most complete systems of natural heal. ing, containing great wisdom for all humanity that all of us should know. The present volume examines the psychological aspect of Ayurveda, which is probably the most important part of the system and the least understood. This book goes into the Ayurvedic view of the mind and its relationship with both body and spirit, which is profound and intricate.

"PLAN OF THE BOOK. This book does not require that the reader possess prior knowledge of Ayurveda, though this is certainly helpful. It introduces the basic factors of Ayurveda, like the biological humors (doshas), particularly as related to psychology. On this foundation, however, the book does go deeply into its subject. It aims at providing the reader with sufficient knowledge to use the information and techniques of Ayurveda to improve his or her own life and consciousness on all levels. It is not simply introductory in nature and should be relevant to psychologists and therapists as well. I am not going to apologize for producing a more technical book on Ayurveda than the beginning reader might understand. There are already a number of introductory books on Ayurveda that can be examined for those who require this. Now there is a need for more advanced books to unfold this important. subject further. Something of the depths of Ayurveda needs to be revealed to complement the general introductions now available. This book is divided into four sections, followed by an appendix. The first section explains the Ayurvedic view of the mind and body and how they function. It begins with the basic material of the three gunas (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas), the three biological humors (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), showing their relationship with the mind. It also explores the nature and functions of the mind in a general way from an Ayurvedic perspective. The second section continues with an in-depth examination of the different functions of awareness through consciousness, intelligence, mind, ego and self. This presents a deeper and more detailed understanding of the mind than in modern psychology, examining all layers of the mind from the subconscious to the superconscious In the third section of the book, we examine various Ayurvedic therapies for the mind. These begin with Ayurvedic counseling methods and the Ayurvedic view of how to treat the mind. Therapies are twofold: outer and inner. Outer therapies are linked with physical modalities like diet, herbs and massage. Inner therapies work through impressions and consist mainly of color, aroma and mantra therapies. The fourth section of the book deals with spiritual and, yogic practices from an Ayurvedic and psychological perspective and summarizes and integrates all the therapies given in the previous section. This allows us to use the wisdom of Ayurveda not only for physical and mental health, but also for spiritual growth. The appendix contains various tables on the functions of the mind and their correspondences. Footnotes, glossaries, bibliography and index follow at the end. The material in Ayurveda and the Mind reflects and builds on that presented in my previous books. There is a chapter on Ayurveda and the mind in my book Ayurvedic Healing: A Comprehensive Guide. The nature of consciousness, from a more spiritual and meditative\' perspective, is examined in Beyond The Mind. The present volume falls in between these two books. It has points in common with Tantric Yoga and the Wisdom Goddesses: Spiritual Secrets of Ayurveda, which deals with the chakras and the energetics of the subtle body. The reader can look into these books or more information on the greater system of which this book is but a part. It is my wish that this book will stimulate more research into the psychological side of Ayurveda and its interface with the science of Yoga. This will add an important new dimension in health and human understanding for the coming century. May the minds of all beings find peace! Mayall the worlds find peace!

"Levels of Ayurvedic Healing. Ayurveda recognizes four primary levels of healing: 1. Disease Treatment 2. Disease Prevention 3. Life Enhancement 4. Awareness Development For most of us, medical treatment begins when we fall ill, It is a form of disease treatment, a response to a condition that has already occurred. It aims at fixing something already broken. However, if medicine begins with the treatment of disease, it is a failure because the disease is already harming us. At this late stage, radical and invasive methods may be required, like drugs or surgery, which have many side effects. A higher level of healing is to eliminate diseases before they manifest, for which invasive methods like drugs or surgery are seldom necessary. To reach this stage we must consider the effects our lifestyle, environment, work and psychological condition. We must cut off the wrong factors in our daily lives that make us vulnerable to disease. To some extent we are always sick because life itself is transient and unstable. There is always some disease attacking us, particularly in changes of season or in the aging process. Each crearure that is born must eventually die. Health is a matter of continual adjustment, like sailing a ship upon the sea. It (an not be permanently achieved and then forgotten, but is an ongoing concern. The third level of treatment is life-enhancemt;nt therapy, which aims at improving our vitality and enabling us to live longer. It does not merely prevent diseases but shows us how to increase our positive vitality. However, Ayurveda aims at more than merely creating health, avoiding disease and helping us live longer. The fourth level of Ayurveda is awareness development. This requires a spiritual approach to life, including meditation. To be healthy is important but health is not an end in itself. It is not enough merely to prolong our lives and have better energy to do the things we want. We must consider what we are using our energy for and why. The quality of our awareness is the real fruit of all that we do. It is our ultimate expression, the essence of who we really are. Our awareness is the only tningthat we can take with us when we die. It can continue growing as the body and mind decline and is our greatest aid in the aging process. The purpose of physical incarnation is to help develop a higher consciousness. This not only lifts us individually but raises the world and the rest of humanity. All our human problems arise from lack of true awareness, which is not merely a lack of information but a failure to understand our place in the universe. Acrually we do not have a a place in the universe at all. The universe rests within us. The entire universe is part of our own greater being. All human beings are part of our own Self. All creatures are but different forms of who we are. They are like the different leaves and branches of the tree of consciousness. True awareness is the recognition of unity through which we transcend personal limitations and understand the Self as All. This is the ultimate goal of Ayurveda, which aims at releasing us from all sorrow and suffering. True awareness is the ultimate cure for all psychological disorders. But to understand it we must first look into the mind and its functions. We must start where we are. In this direction, our journey proceeds.",3352," - Ayurveda recognizes four primary levels of healing: disease treatment, disease prevention, life enhancement, and awareness development.\n- Disease treatment is a response to a condition that has already occurred, while disease prevention aims at eliminating diseases before they manifest.\n- Life enhancement therapy focuses on improving vitality and enabling us to live longer, while awareness development requires a spiritual approach to life, including meditation.\n- Ayurveda\'s ultimate goal is true awareness, which transcends personal limitations and recognizes unity with the universe, aiming at releasing us from all sorrow and suffering.",649,-80.63842482,2,,"1.

"Constitutional Examination. How To Determine Your Unique Psycho-physical Nature. Each one of us possesses all three biological humors. However, their proportion varies according to the individual. One humor will usually predominate and make its characteristic mark upon our disposition. Some individuals are strongly of one type. These are called pure Vata (pure air), pure Pitta (pure fire) and pure Kapha (pure water) types. Mixed types occur as when two or more humors stand in equal proportion. Three different dual types exist as Vata-Pitta (air-fire), Vata-Kapha (airwater) and Pitta-Kapha (fire-water). An even type in which all three humors are in balance, or VPK type, is also found, making seven major types in all. Note which humor you check the most; this will usually indicate your constiturion (though it is helpful to consult an Ayurvedic practitioner to make sure). Also remember that even when you fall clearly into one category, you will have your unique characteristics. These types are a basis for more specific treatment and should not be turned into stereotypes. Prana, Tejas and Ojas. The Master Forms of Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Vata, Pitta and Kapha have subtle counterparts on the level of vital energy. These are Prana, Tejas and Ojas, which we will call the \"three vital essences.\" Prana, Tejas and Ojas are the master forms of Vata, Pitta and Kapha. They control ordinary mind-body functions and keep us healthy and free of disease. If reoriented properly, they unfold higher evolutionary potentials. as well. They are the positive essences of the three biological humors that sustain positive health. While increases in the biological humors promote disease, increases in the vital essences promote positive health (unless one of these is increased without properly developing the others). These three forces are the keys to vitality, clarity and endurance, necessary for us to really feel healthy, fearless and confident. - PRANA: primal life-force the subtle energy of air as the master force behind all mind-body functions. It is responsible for coordination of breath, senses and mind. On an inner level, it governs the development of higher states of consciousness. - TEJAS: inner radiance the subtle energy of fire through which we digest impressions and thoughts. On an inner level, it governs the development of higher perceptual capacities. - OJAS: primal vigor the subtle energy of water as our vital energy reserve, the essence of digested food, impressions and thought. On an inner level it gives calm, and supports and nourishes all higher states of consc lOusness. Psychological Functions of the Three Vital Essences. Prana in the mind allows it to move and respond to the challenges of life. Tejas in the mind enables it to perceive and to judge correctly. Ojas in the mind gives patience and endurance that provides psychological stability. Prana in our deeper consciousness energizes us throughout the process of reincarnation, giving life to all aspects of out nature. Tejas in consciousness holds the accumulated insight of our will and spiritual aspiration. Ojas in consciousness is the material power from which the soul produces all its various bodies. Each of these three factors has an emotional effect as well. Prana maintains emotional harmony, balance, and creativity. Tejas gives courage, fearlessness, and vigor that allows us to accomplish extraordinary actions. Ojas provides peace, calm and contentment. Without these emotional sustaining forces, the mind cannot accomplish anything significant. How Prana, Tejas and Ojas are Built Up. Prana, Tejas and Ojas are built up in two ways. On a gross level, they derive from the essence of the nutrients we take into the body as food, heat and air. On a subtle level, they are fed by the impressions we take in through the senses. Key to the functioning of Prana, Tejas and Ojas is the reproductive fluid, which functions as their container in the physical body. It is the ultimate product of the food we take in that holds our strongest energies. Prana is the life-creating capacity inherent in the reproductive fluid. This creates children through the sexual act, but can be directed inwardly to rejuvenate both body and mind. Tejas is the capacity of the reproductive fluid to give courage and daring. For example, it enables male animals to fight with great strength in order to mate. Inwardly, it can give us vigor and decisiveness for any important action. Ojas is the power of the reproductive fluid to promote endurance, which provides the ability to sustain us not only sexually but through all forms sustained exertion, physically and mentally. Without the proper reserve of reproductive fluids, we must be deficient in Prana, Tejas and Ojas, which can negatively impact both physical and psychological health. Ayurveda emphasizes preserving enough of our reproductive fluid to maintain these three vital essences. It also shows us ways to develop these three forces when they are insufficient. On a subtle level, Ojas is fed through the sensory impressions of taste and smell. Tejas is the essence of the heat we absorb, not only through food but also through the skin, where we absorb sunlight. Tejas is fed through visual impressions. Prana is the vital energy we take in, not only through food but through liquids, and, of course, through breathing. Prana is carried by the fluids in our body, the blood and plasma, which serve as its vehicle. OUf body fluids are energized by the Prana we take in. Prana is also absorbed through the senses of hearing and touch. Prana, Tejas and Ojas and Health Imbalances. Psychological imbalances are closely related to the conditions of Prana, Tejas and Ojas. Prana is responsible for the enthusiasm and expression in the psyche, without which we suffer from depression and mental stagnation. Tejas governs mental digestion and absorption, without which we lack clarity and determination. Ojas provides psychological stability and endurance, without which we experience anxiety and mental fatigue. Without the proper vital energies, the mind cannot function properly. We cannot heal the mind without improving and harmonizing its energies. We will refer to Prana, Tejas and Ojas as background concepts throughout the book. While not as important as Vata, Pitta and Kapha, they must not be overlooked either. Please relate them back to Vata, Pitta and Kapha as their positive forms, or to the elements of air, fire and water for easy understanding.",6502,"1.

"CORRESPONDENCES OF THE THREE GUNAS Sattva and the Mind. The mind, or consciousness in general, is naturally the domain of Sattva. Consciousness itself is called Sat tva in Sanskrit. Unless the mind is calm and clear, we cannot perceive anything properly. Sat tva creates clarity, through which we perceive the truth of things, and gives light, concentration and devotion. Rajas and Tamas\' are factors of mental disharmony, causing agitation and delusion. They result in wrong imagination and misperception. From Rajas comes the false idea of the external world as real in itself, which causes us ro seek happiness outside ourselves and lose track of our inner peace. Rajas creates desire, distortion, turbulence and emotional upset. It predominates in the sensory aspect of the mind because the senses are ever-moving and seeking various objects. As long as we remain immersed in the pursuit of sensory enjoyment, we fall under the instability of Rajas. From Tamas comes the ignorance that veils our true nature and weakens our power of perception. Through it arises the idea of an ego or separate self, by which we feel ourselves to be alone and isolated. Tamas prevails in consciousness identified with the physical body, which is dull and limited. As long our identity and sense of well-being is primarily physical, we remain in the dark realm of Tamas. Sattva is the balance of Rajas and Tamas, combining the energy of Rajas with the stability 9f Tamas. By increasing Sattva, one gains peace and harmony, and returns to Primordial Nature, and Pure Spirit in which is liberation. However, attachment to Sattva, such as clinging to virtue, can bind the mind. For this reason we must strive to devel. op pure Sattva, which is its detached form, or Sattva not clinging to its own qualities. Pure Sattva does not condemn Raias and Tamas, but understan,ds their place in the cosmic harmony, which is as outer factors of life and body whose proper place is apart from our true nature. When pure Sattva prevails in our consciousness, we transcend time and space and discover our eternal Self. The soul regains its basic purity and unites with God. Wheo out of balance, the three gunas bring about the process of cosmic evolurion through which the soul evolves through the kingdoms of Nature, experiencing birch and death, happiness and sorrow in various bodies. The movement of the three gunas is coterminous with creation. Sattva as the state of balance is responsible for all true health and healing. Health is maintained by Sattvic living, hich is living in harmony with Nature and our inner Self, cultivating purity, clarity and peace. Rajas and Tamas are the factors that cause disease. Rajas causes pain, agitation and the dissipation of energy. Tamas brings abour stagnation, decay and death. Rajas and Tamas usually work together. Rajas brings abour the over-expression of energy, which eventually leads to exhaustion, in which Tamas prevails. For example, too much spicy food, alcohol, and sexual indulgence are initially Rajasic or stimulating. These eventually lead to such Tamasic conditions as fatigue and collapse of energy. On a psychological level, too much Rajas, which is turbulent emotion, leads to Tamas or mental dullness and depression. Mental Types According to the Gunas. To have Sattva predominant in our nature is the key to health, creativity and spirituality. Sattvic people possess an harmonious and adaptable nature which gives the greatest. freedom from disease, both physical and mental.. They strive toward balance and have peace of mind that cuts off the psychological root of disease. They are considerate of others and take care of themselves. They see all life as a learning experience and look for the good in all things, even in disease, which they strive to understand, not merely to suppress  Rajasic people have good energy but burn themselves out through excessive activity. Their minds are usually agitated and seldom at peace. They have strong opinions and seek power over others, often regardless of the means. They are impatient and inconsistent in dealing with their problems and do not wish to tlike the time or responsibility to get well. They blame others for their problems, including their therapists. Rajasic people can accomplish their goals and are generally in control of their lives. However, they are not awake to their spiritual purpose, and are dominated by the ego in their pursuit of happiness. Life brings them shocks, which can cause them great sufferjng, particularly when they lose control. Even when they achieve their goals, they find that they are still not happy. Tamasic types have deep-seated psychological blockages. Their energy and emotion tend to be stagnant and repressed, and they do not know what their problems really are. They do not seek proper treatment and usually have poor hygiene or poor self-care habits. They accfPt their condition as fate and do not take advantage of the methods that may alleviate their problems. They allow other people and negative influences to dominate them and do not like to be responsible for their lives. They prefer not to deal with their problems or will not let others know about them, which only allows the problems to get worse. Mental Constitution According to the Three Gunas. The gunas show our mental and spiritual state, through which we can measure our propensity for psychological problems. The following test is a good index of these qualities and how they work within our life and character. The answers on the left indicate Sattva, in the middle Rajas, and on the right Tamas. Please fill out this form carefully and honestly. After answering the questionnaire for yourself, you should have someone who knows you well, like your husband, wife or close friend, fill it out for you also. Note the difference between how you view yourself and how others see you. For most of us, our answers will generally fall in the middle or Rajasic area, which is the, main spiritual state in our active and outgoing culture 1:oday. We will have various psychological problems but can usually deal with them. A Sattvic nature shows a spiritual disposition with few psychological issues. A highly Sattvic nature is rare at any time and shows a saint or sage. A Tamasic person has a danger of severe psychological problems but would be unlikely to fill out such a chart or even read such a book. The areas in ourselves that we can improve from Tamas to Rajas or from Rajas to Sattva will aid in our peace of mind and spiritual growth. We should do all we can to make such changes.",6590,"1.

"The Three Gunas and Therapy. Many different types of medical and healing therapies exist for the mind. To benefit from them properly and to avoid their possible side-effects, we must understand their approach and when they are useful. Here Ayurveda helps us greatly by showing how healing therapies relate to these three gunas. This provides us with a deep understanding of the healing process and its likely results. Sattvic therapies work through Sattvic qualities of love, peace and nonviolence. Rajasic therapies work through Rajasic qualities of stimulation, energization and agitation. Tamasic therapies work through Tamasic qualities of sedation, sleep and grounding. Ayurvedic therapies are primarily Sattvic and employ Rajasic and Tamasic modalities only under special Circumstances. Sattvic healing uses Nature, the life force and the power of the cosmic mind, through such treatment methods as herbs, vegetarian diet, mantra and meditation. Rajas can occasionally be useful in the healing process. Rajas helps break up Tamas, while Sattva, being a condition of harmony, does not always have the ability to do so. It is often necessary to move from Tamas to Rajas in order to returh to Sattva, like needing to stimulate or shock a person into awakening to their repressed pain. Tamas is seldom useful in the healing process except when required to sedate too high Rajas. For example, a person in hysteria, an excess Rajas condition, may require a strong sedative herb or drug, a Tamasic therapy. In this case Sattva would be too mild to calm Rajas. Ayurvedic psychology aims at moving the mind from Tamas to Rajas and eventually to Sattva. This means moving from an ignorant and physically-oriented life (Tamas), to one of vitality and self-expression (Rajas), and finally to one of peace and enlightenment (Sattva).8 Three Stages of Mental Healing. 1. Breaking up Tamas/developing Rajas -- moving from mental inertia to moving self-motivated action. 2. Calming Rajas/developing Sattva -- moving from self-motivated action to selfless service. 3. Perfecting Sattva -- moving from selfless service to meditation. Naturally it is important to know what stage is appropriate for a person. A person in a Tamasic condition requires outer activity to break up their inertia; he or she cannot simply be asked to sit quietly and meditate. At such times Rajasic (active) methods are necessary and Sattvic (passive) methods may not be sufficient. The per son requires communication and working with other people. A person in a. Rajasic condition, however, requires a reduction of activity and interiorization of consciousness (development of Sattva). Yet this must be done gradually because Rajas does not subside all at once. The person must be introduced into meditation through practical therapies of yogic postures, mantras or visualizations. A person in a Sattvic condition requires spiritual practices and not ordinary psychological treatment, and can easily move into meditation without much external support. However, these three stages are not simply different levels. We all have Tamasic, Rajasic and Sattvic factors in our minds. We all need each of these three processes to some degree. There are times when our minds are Tamasic, like right after waking up in the morning or when daydreaming in the afternoon. Whenever we are mentally dull or emotionally depressed, Tamas is predominant. Rajas prevails when we are agitated, disturbed, active or outgoing, like when we are very busy working with a number of people or projects. Sat tva prevails when we are quiet, peaceful and content, or naturally fall into meditation. Similarly we\' should not judge other people by how they appear when dominated by one quality only. Even a spiritually advanced person has Tamasic moments or periods when he or she may do something regrettable. In the same way, spiritually undeveloped persons have Sattvic moments when they may do something inspired, noble or kind. When looking at ourselves, we should try to see all three factors in our nature and behavior and try to develop our Sattvic side. STAGE 1 -- PERSONAL HEALING. Breaking Up Tamas/ Moving from Tamas to Rajas. For this transition, fire is necessary. We must wake up, act and begin to change. Deep-seated patterns of attachment, stagnation and depression must be released. We must recognize our suffering and learn from it, confronting our pain, including what we have suppressed or ignored for years. A new sense of who we are and what we need to do is required. Action (Rajas) is indicated, not only in the mind but involving outer aspects of our lives. We must break with the past, bring new energies into our lives, perhaps change jobs or modify our relationships, or 9 move to a new locale. STAGE HEALING OF HUMANITY. Calming Rajas/ Moving from Rajas to Sattva. For this transition, space-is necessary. We must surrender our pain and give up our personal seeking, letting go of individual hurts and sorrows. Egoistic drives and motivations must be surrendered for the greater good. We must depersonalize our problems and look ro understand the entire human condition and the pain of others. Leaving behind our personal problems, we must take up the problems of humanity, opening up to the suffering of others as our own. We must learn that life creates suffering in order to help us grow spiritually. This is a stage of service and charity. STAGE 3 -- UNIVERSAL PEACE. Developing Pure Sattva. To bring about this transition, we must develop love and awareness as universal forces. We must learn to transcend the limitations of the human condition to our higher spiritual nature. Inner peace must become our dominant force. We should no longer seek to overcome our pain but to develop our joy. We should no longer be ce.ntered in our personal or collective problems but in developing communion with the greater universe and the Divine powers at work within it. At this stage we move from the human aspect of our condition to the universal aspect, becoming open to all life. This is the stage of spiritual practice. It is beyond all ordinary healing and works to heal our relationship with God or the inner Self. As you go through this book remember the. three gunas. We will explore how they work according to the different layers and functions of the mind. Go to the Sattvic core of your being to understand this wisdom of Ayurveda.",6398,"1.

"4. The Nature of the Mind. It is amazing to note that so many different ideas exist about the nature of the mind and how it functions. Different systems of psychology, philosophy and religion define the mind in ways that can be radically different or even contradictory to one another. All of us its form, agree on the basic facts of the physical body sttucture and function. No one holds that the body has three legs, or that the stomach thinks and the brain digests food. The reason for this is that the body is easy to observe. Yet while we can easily list the main systems of the physical body, we find it difficult to do so for the mind. The mind appears as an amorphous or structureless entity, rather than a precise instrument like the body. Though we all have minds and use them constantly, we do not know what our mind really is. We are so caught up in the mind\'s activities that we do not take the time to discover what the mind itself really is. In the realm of psychology, we are still groping in the dark, trying to treat an entity whose character eludes us. Without knowing the nature of the mind and its functions, how can we really approach it? After all, how we perceive the mind is the basis of any psychological diagnosis and treatment. The problem is that to know the mind we must first know ourselves. We must understand who we really are. Thought, as we ordinarily know it, is a function of the ego or separate self. A subjective personal bias colors how we look at the mind, rendering an objective assessment of its capacities almost impossible. The first step in any true psychology, therefore, is to understand the mind and how it works. What is the nature of this marvelous instrument called the mind? What is its relationship with who we are? What is its connection with the body? What is the right function of the mind? Can. we learn to see the mind as objectively as we see our hands and feet? Here Ayurveda and Yoga offer tremendous insights. Getting to Know the Mind . Can one imagine being put into the driver\'s seat of an automobile with the engine running and not knowing how to drive, not knowing how to use the brakes, the steering wheel or the clutch? Narurally we would get into an accident and, should we survive, would end up permanently afraid of driving. We are in a not too different situation with our minds. Our awareness is placed in the mind when we are born, but we are not taught how to use the mind, its sensitivities and emotions. We are not taught the meaning of its states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. We are not shown the comparative functions of reason, feeling, will and sensory perception. We are left in the dark because our parents and society do not understand the mind and how it works. The mind is the main vehicle we use for all that we do, yet few, if any of us, know how to use and care for it properly. We all suffer from ignorance of the nature of the mind. All problems we encounter in life are based ultimately upon not knowing the mind and its functions. From this primary problem, various secondary problems arise like how to fulfill our desires, or how to avoid what we fear which, however important these may appear, are merely the natural consequence of this basic ignorance about the mind. For example, if we do not know how to drive a car properly, the issue of where to go with it is not important. However, we take these derivative problems as primary or blame others for them, turning them into social, moral, or political issues, not realizing, that they are just one problem not understanding the mind. From a wrong understanding of the mind, we develop wrong ideas about the world and run into difficulty in our social interactions. To use another analogy: if we do not understand how fireworks, we may burn ourselves. This does not mean we are a bad person or that fire is bad, but only that we do not understand fire and its properties. The mind has its qualities and, like fire, can be used for both good and bad. It can provide great happiness or wreak tremendous havoc in the world, as history has shown again and again. All psychological problems are nothing more than a wrong use of the mind, which arises from ignorance of how the mind works. The solution to all our mental problems is to learn to use the mind properly. This is true whatever our psychological problems may be. More important than any examination of our personal or social problems is educating our.selves about the nature of the mind. All the problems that appear so immediate and important like whether we will be loved or if our friends and family can be happy are not the real issue and cannot be solved directly. The real issue is how to use the most important and central instrument in our livesthe mind itself. Learning the right use of the mind not only solves our psychological problems, but directs us to our higher potential of Self-realization. It leads to the spiritual life, which is our real occupation as conscious beings. Then we can transcend the mind which is inherently limited to Pure Awareness unbounded by time, space or causation. For all things in life, we must start with understanding the mind.",5186,"1. The Nature of the Mind: Different systems of psychology, philosophy, and religion define the mind in ways that can be radically different or even contradictory to one another. We agree on the basic facts of the physical body structure and function but struggle to define the mind\'s nature.\n2. Understanding the Mind: To know the mind, we must first understand ourselves.

"5. The Five Elements and the Mind. Have you ever looked at the workings of your mind the way you would observe the world of Nature around you? According to Ayurveda, if we want to understand how our mind works, the best way is to look at how Nature operates. We must see how wind, fire and rain function in the psyche. We must learn to observe the storms of emotion, the light or half-light of reason, and all the rhythms through which not only our body, but also our mind and senses move. The mind is a formation of Nature, created according to her marvelous organic intelligence. The mind has the same basic strucrure as the universe and follows the same immurable laws. We live in a multi-level cosmos, including matter, energy, and mind on parallel and interdependent levels, like a magnificent crystal or gigantic lotus. Each level helps us understand the others and, through the ourer, we gain the key to the inner. The five elements are one of the main themes of Ayurvedic thought, and of related spiritual and healing systems. They are a great analog for all existence. Most of us do not think of the mind in terms of the elements, however. Yet, as a part of Nature, the mind also reflects the great elements through which Nature functions. To introduce the Ayurvedic view of the mind, we can approach it according to the elements. Mind and the Elements. The mind transcends all the five gross elements because, through the mind, we can perceive all the elements and their interrelationships. We can observe, imagine and contemplate all the forms of earth, water, fire, air and ether. Yet the elements do provide a key to how the mind works. Though the elements in the mind are more subtle than those in the body, they retain the, same basic attributes and actions. We can understand the mental elements through the analogy of the physical. The mind is a creation primarily of the ether element of Nature. In substance, the mind is like space expansive, open and all-pervading. Like space, it can hold innumerable forms and not be exhausted by them. The more evolved the mind becomes, the greater becomes its space. \' The less evolved the mind, the less expansive its space. Sorrow is nothing but a constricted mind space, like a bird in a cage. Bliss is an unlimited mind space, like a bird flying free in the sky. In movement, howevr, the mind is like the wind. Air is its secondary element. There is nothing faster in movement than the mind. It is faster even than the speed of light. Look at your mind. It is always busy coordinating the body and senses, gathering information, making judgments, reacting emotionally, and endlessly thinking. This ongoing movement occurs because of the mind\'s connection with the air element. Though ether and air are the main elements relating to the mind, the ot.her elements have their place in the mind as well. The mind has its fire or light through which it can perceive things: This gives the mind a quality of illumination and a capacity of understanding. Similarly, the mind has a watery quality of emotion, empathy and feeling. Finally, it carries a certain weight of earth, memory, and attachment. The mind contains all the elements within itself according to its differing qualities and actions. The most subtle aspect of the elements makes up the mind. The mind space is more subtle than the physical space, which it pervades. The mind\'s air-like movement travels even in front of the wind. Fire in the mind can even perceive all external forms of light. Water in the mind or emotion is more subtle even than the external air. Earth in the mind, the mind\'s weight. of attachments and opinions, or seed level of the elements cannot be weighed. The causal makes up the mind and through it create the gross or physical elements.

Its earthly weight of attachments cannot be weighed, and its causal aspect creates the gross or physical elements.\n\nThe mind has three layers: the causal, which is the most subtle and creates the other layers; the subtle, which includes the mind\'s thoughts and emotions; and the gross, which is the body and senses. These layers are interconnected and influence each other.",2013,-47.20692368,,
"The mind has three basic layers -- inner, intermediate and outer.. 1. The inner mind consists ofthe deep core of feeling and knowing. It holds the tendencies that we carry deep inside ourselves and may _never express or come to grips with in our outer lives. 2. The outer mind is the part of the mind dominated by the senses and emotions in which we ordinarily function on a daily basis, gathering impressions and acting in the outer world. 3. The intermediate mind is our capacity to bring outer impressions to the inside and inner tendencies to the outside. It mediates between transient sensory impressions and emotions on one side, and deep and abiding internal feelings on the other. It functions through reason and perception to help us make judgments and decisions. These three aspects of the mind follow a similar model as Vata, Pitta and Kapha or air, fire and water, taking this energetic to a deeper level. Inner Mind or Deeper Consciousness - Air. Air exists in the mind as the underlying mental sensitivity or deeper feeling nature. It is the background vibratory field of energies, habits and tendencies that sustain the mind, by which we are continually thinking. Air is the capacity of the mind to relate, identify itself and feel alive. Through it we move, act and function as conscious beings. It constitutes the heart or core consciousness, which is not always evident at the surface bur is the motivating force behind the mind\'s other functions. Like air, the mind possesses a capacity for change, response, and \'transformation, and consists of various energies and impulses in a self-adjusting field. Our consciousness is a field of motion, an interacting dynamism of tendencies, latencies and impressions, only a few of which reach the outer or self-conscious mind which dominates our normal waking state. Most of what we call the unconscious, subconscious and superconscious is this inner mind, of which we are not ordinarily aware. This vibratory field of core thoughts and feelings, however, is a conditioned consciousness. It constitutes the spontaneous and automatic habits and tendencies within us. It is different from pure or unconditioned consciousness which is our true Self (note below). Intermediate Mind or Intelligence - Fire. Fire exists in the mind as the rational or discriminating faculty which allows us to perceive and to judge things. Our determinations of what is true and false, real and unreal, good and bad, valuable or worthless are outcomes of this capacity to weigh, measure and evaluate. It allows us to examine impressions to discern the object from our impression of it. It enables us to judge our experienc to discover what it really means. In this way, it mediates between the inner core consciousness and our outer sensory functions. Reason, like fire, has a hot and luminous nature that provides the ability to ascertain and discern. Reason, like fire, burns, digests and converts things into more subtle forms that nourish our awareness. Reason digests our impressions, feelings and thoughts and allows us to derive knowledge from them, putting each in its appropriate place relative to our understanding of reality. Intelligence is the part of our consciousness articulated rationally and, therefore, brought to light. The greater and unarticulated part of the mind, the deeper consciousness, remains unconscious to our ordinary mind, and therefore appears to be dark. We enter into the rational part of the mind for important judgments, decisions and to arrive at real understanding. It is the part of the greater field of consciousness that we have brought to light and made our own. Outer Mind, Sensation-Emotion Water. Water exists in the mind as the emotional nature, our ability to connect with the external world, which is the seeking of consciousness to take form. This includes our capacity to gather sensory impressions and respond to them through like\' and dislike, attraction and repulsion, fear and desire. Water is the formative aspect of mind which allows us to imagine, plan and construct our reality. It is the basis of will, motivation and action in the external world. It is the part of the mind, ever flowing outward, seeking to incarnate itself in matter and accumulate for itself the things of the world. Similarly, it is ever gathering impressions from the ourside, allowing us to hold and accumulate them within. Through the outer mind and its expressive capacity, we function in the world and feel ourselves to be part of an outer reality.

"Workings of the Levels of the Mind. The outer mind is the doorway by which impressions from the external world enter into our consciousness through the gates of the senses. Intelligence, or intermediate mind, is the doorman who determines which impressions and energies can come in. Consciousness, or the inner mind, is the interior of the room in which these energies get deposited in the form of memories and tendencies, after they are allowed to enter. Once impressions have become deposited in our inner consciousness, they grow like seeds and eventually impel us to act according to their nature. They produce various motivations which result in the actions or karmas that determine the movement of our lives. Impressions do not automatically enter into the inner mind. They only come in when we react to things in the form of dualistic emotions, likes and dislikes, love and hate, acceptance and rejection. Mere sensory perception by itself does not cause external energies to enter the mind. Detached observation cuts off external forces from entering the mind, while allowing us to observe them for what they are and respond to them appropriately. Detached observation digests impressions, allowing us to learn from them and not be limited by them. As the doorkeeper, intelligence has the capacity to control the outer or sense mind and determine what comes in. This depends upon the principles according to which our reason is trained to work. If our reasoning faculty is not clear, then we rationalize our likes and dislikes rather than discern the ttuth of things. Reason, like a doorkeeper who has been bribed, lets any influence into the mind and then seeks a reason to justify letting it stay. Our inner mind, the deeper feeling nature of the heart is passive and innocent like a child. Whatever we open up our heart to gets deposited within it. The feeling nature is sensitive and vulnerable. It can be disturbed or motivated by whatever we let in. Therefore, it is very important to discriminate properly what we let into our hearts. Once we have accepted things at a heart level, we regard them as our own and can no longer examine them objectively, just as a mother can never criticize her own children. The Perceptual Process. Let us examine our perceptual process to clarify this further. First we gather impressions based upon where we place our attention. For example, we look out the window and see the stature and dress of a person walking\' by. This is the\' function of the outer mind. Second we evaluate the impressions and come to a conclusion abour what the object is. It\' is our neighbor, Sam. This is the function of intelligence. Third, the impression of the object gets deposited in our deeper consciousness as a memory. We remember that Sam walked by the house this morning. In. this process ego surfaces at some point, generally after recognizing the object. When we recognize our neighbor, we remember that we like him for some remark he said about us. The outer mind works to select and gather impressions. It provides images like an object seen in a mirror, which is merely presented but not perceived. Intelligence, or the intermediate mind, allows us to recognize particular objects from the field of impressions. The ego allows us to identify an impression as belonging to us or to otherwise subjectively react to it. The inner mind, or feeling nature, allows the impression to be deposited and causes us to hold a feeling about it.",3471,"1.
