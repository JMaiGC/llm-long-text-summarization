"INTRODUCTION+ Mind-body therapies, including yoga therapy, are proposed to benefit health and well-being through an integration of top-down and bottom-up processes facilitating bidirectional communication between the brain and body (Muehsam et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2010). Top-down processes, such as the regulation of attention and setting of intention, have been shown to decrease psychological stress as well as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and in turn modulate immune function and inflammation (Muehsam et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2010). Bottom-up processes, promoted by breathing techniques and movement practices, have been shown to influence musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous system function and also affect HPA and SNS activity, with concomitant changes in immune function and emotional well- being (Muehsam et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2010). The top-down and bottom-up processes employed in mind-body therapies may regulate autonomic, neuroendocrine, emotional, and behavioral activation and support an individual’s response to challenges (Taylor et al., 2010). Self-regulation, a conscious ability to maintain stability of the system by managing or altering responses to threat or adversity, may reduce symptoms of diverse conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, neurodegenerative conditions, chronic pain, depression, and PTSD through the mitigation of allostatic load, with an accompanying shift in autonomic state (Gard et al., 2014; Muehsam et al., 2017; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2010). Gard et al. (2014) have proposed such a model of top-down and bottom-up self-regulatory mechanisms of yoga for psychological health. Resilience may provide another benefit of mind-body therapies, as it includes the ability of an individual to bounce back and adapt in response to adversity and/or stressful circumstances in a timely way such that psychophysiological resources are conserved (Haase et al., 2016; Resnick et al., 2011; Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004; Whitson et al., 2016). High resilience is correlated with quicker cardiovascular recovery following subjective emotional experiences (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2007), less perceived stress, greater recovery from illness or trauma, and better management of dementia and chronic pain (Resnick et al., 2011). Compromised resilience is linked to dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) through measures of vagal regulation (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) (Dale et al., 2009). Yoga is correlated with improvement in both measures of psychological resilience (Dale et al., 2011) and vagal regulation (Chu et al., 2017; Khattab et al., 2007; Sarang & Telles, 2006; Telles et al., 2016; Tyagi & Cohen, 2016). This chapter explores the integration of top-down and bottom-up processes for self-regulation and resilience through both Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 2011) and yoga therapy. Polyvagal Theory is described in relation to contemporary understandings of interoception as well as the biobehavioral theory of the preparatory set, which is defined later. This will help to lay out an integrated systems view from which mind-body therapies facilitate the emergence of physiological, emotional, and behavioral characteristics for the promotion of self-regulation and resilience. We will examine the convergence of the neural platforms, described in Polyvagal Theory, with the three gunas, a foundational concept of yogic philosophy that describes the qualities of material nature. Both Polyvagal Theory and yoga provide frameworks for understanding how underlying neural platforms (Polyvagal Theory) and gunas (yoga) link emergence and connectivity between physiological, psychological, and behavioral attributes. By affecting the neural platform, or guna predominance, as well as one’s relationship to the continual shifting of these neural platforms, or gunas, the individual learns skills for self-regulation and resilience. Moreover, these frameworks share characteristics that parallel one another, where the neural platform reflects the guna predominance, and the guna predominance reflects the neural platform (see Figure 5.1). This exploration is intended to be a comparative and translatory approach aimed at enabling the complexity of the yoga tradition to be understood for its benefits and application into modern health care contexts, while still rooted in its own traditional wisdom and explanatory framework. A model through which self-regulation and resilience occurs is described from a yoga foundational framework, which converges with current ideas in neurophysiology and biobehavioral regulation (see Figure 5.1).

"POLYVAGAL THEORY+ Polyvagal Theory and other emerging theories such as neurovisceral integration (Smith et al., 2017; Thayer & Lane, 2000), help elucidate connections between the systems of the body, the brain, and the processes of the mind, offering increased insight into complex patterns of integrated top-down and bottom-up processes that are inherent to mind-body therapies. Polyvagal Theory delineates three distinct neural platforms in response to perceived risk (i.e., safety, danger, life threat) in the environment that operate in a phylogenetically determined hierarchy consistent with the Jacksonian principle of dissolution (Jackson, 1884; Porges, 2001, 2003). Polyvagal Theory introduces the concept of neuroception to describe the subconscious detection of safety or danger in the environment reflected in bottom-up processes involving vagal afferents, sensory input related to external challenges and endocrine mechanisms that are the consequences of reflexive top-down mechanisms evaluating environmental risk prior to conscious elaboration by higher brain centers (Porges, 2003). The three polyvagal neural platforms, as described below, are linked to the behaviors of social communication, defensive strategy of mobilization, and defensive immobilization (Porges, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2011). 1. The ventral vagal complex (VVC) provides the neural structures that mediate the social engagement system. When safety is detected in the internal and external environment, the VVC provides a neural platform to support prosocial behavior and social connection by linking the neural regulation of visceral states, supporting homeostasis and restoration to facial expressivity and the receptive and expressive domains of communication (e.g., prosodic vocalizations and enhanced ability to listen to voices). The motor component of the VVC, which originates in the nucleus ambiguus (NA), regulates and coordinates the muscles of the face and head with the bronchi and heart. These connections help orient the person toward human connection and engagement in prosocial interactions and provide more flexible and adaptive responses to environmental challenges, including social interactions (Porges, 2011, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017). 2. The SNS is frequently associated with fight-flight behaviors. Fight- flight behaviors require activation of the SNS and are the initial and primary defense strategies recruited by mammals. This defense strategy requires increased metabolic output to support mobilization behaviors. Within Polyvagal Theory, the recruitment of the SNS in defense follows the Jacksonian principle of dissolution and reflects the adaptive reactions of a phylogenetically ordered response hierarchy in which the VVC is inadequate to mitigate threat. When the SNS circuit is recruited, there are massive physiological changes, including an increase in muscle tone, shunting of blood from the periphery, inhibition of gastrointestinal function, a dilation of the bronchi, increases in heart rate and respiratory rate, and a release of catecholamines. This mobilization of physiological resources sets the stage for responding to real or assumed danger in the environment and toward the end goals of safety and survival. When the SNS becomes the dominant neural platform, the VVC influence may be inhibited in favor of mobilizing resources for rapid action. Whereas prosocial behaviors and social connection are associated with the VVC, in the absence of VVC influences, the SNS is associated with behaviors and emotions such as fear or anger that help to orient to the environment for protection or safety. 3. The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) arises from the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and provides the primary vagal motor fibers to organs located below the diaphragm. In the absence of cues of safety, this circuit evolved to adaptably respond to immense danger or terror and is the most primitive (i.e., evolutionarily oldest) response to stress. Activation of the DVC in defense results in a passive response characterized by decreased muscle tone, dramatic reduction of cardiac output to reserve metabolic resources, and alteration in bowel and bladder function via reflexive defecation and urination to reduce metabolic demands of digestion and other bodily processes. This inhibition of viscera reflects an attempt to reduce metabolic and oxygen demands to the smallest amount necessary for survival. Behaviorally, this is often referred to as immobilization or shutdown associated with feigning death, behavioral shutdown, collapse, or freeze responses, and may be experienced in humans as a disembodied dissociative state that may include loss of consciousness. Polyvagal Theory posits that through these neural platforms, particular physiological states, psychological attributes, and social processes are connected, emerge, and are made accessible to the individual (Porges, 1998, 2003, 2011, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017). The physiological state established by these neural platforms in response to threat or safety (as determined via the integrated processes of neuroception) allows for or limits the range of emotional and behavioral characteristics that are accessible to the individual (Porges, 2003). A core aspect of Polyvagal Theory is that patterns of physiological state, emotion, and behavior are particular to each neural platform (for a detailed review of the neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and evolutionary biological bases of Polyvagal Theory, see Porges [1995, 1998, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2011]). For example, the neural platform of the VVC is proposed to connect visceral homeostasis with emotional characteristics and prosocial behaviors that are incompatible with the neurophysiological states, emotional characteristics, or social behaviors that manifest in the neural platforms of defensive strategies seen in SNS or DVC activation. When the VVC is dominant, the vagal brake is implemented, and prosocial behaviors and emotional states such as connection and love have increased potential to emerge. When the SNS is the primary defensive strategy, the NA turns off the inhibitory action of the ventral vagal pathway to the heart to enable sympathetic activation, and behavioral and emotional strategies of mobilization are supported. If the DVC immobility response is the defensive strategy, the dorsal motor nucleus is activated as a protective mechanism from pain or potential death, and active response strategies are not available (Porges, 1998, 2003, 2009, 2011; Porges et al., 2008; Porges & Carter, 2017). It is important to note that the VVC has other attributes that enable blended states with the SNS (e.g., play) or with the DVC (e.g., intimacy). However, in these examples of blended states, the VVC remains easily accessible and functionally contains the subordinate circuits. When the VVC is functionally withdrawn, it promotes accessibility of the SNS as a defense fight-flight system. Similarly, the SNS functionally inhibits access to the DVC immobilization shutdown response. Thus, the profound shutdown reactions that may lead to death become neurophysiologically accessible only when the SNS is reflexively inhibited.```"",",7213,"**Polyvagal Theory:**\n\n- Offers increased

"VAGAL ACTIVITY, INTEROCEPTION, REGULATION, AND RESILIENCE+ Vagal activity, via ventral vagal pathways, is suggested to be reflective of regulation and resilience of the system, where high cardiac vagal tone correlates with more adaptive top-down and bottom-up processes such as attention regulation, affective processing, and flexibility of physiological systems to adapt and respond to the environment (Park & Thayer, 2014; Porges, 2011; Streeter et al., 2012; Strigo & Craig, 2016; Thayer & Lane, 2000). Vagal control has also been shown to correlate with differential activation in brain regions that regulate responses to threat appraisal, interoception, emotion regulation, and the promotion of greater flexibility in response to challenge (Park & Thayer, 2014; Streeter et al., 2012). Conversely, low vagal regulation has been associated with maladaptive bottom-up and top-down processing, resulting in poor self-regulation, less behavioral flexibility, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and adverse health outcomes including increased mortality in conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and trauma (Muehsam et al., 2017; Park & Thayer, 2014; Thayer & Lane, 2000; Tsuji et al., 1994). The vagus nerve is composed of 80% afferent fibers and serves as an important conduit for interoceptive communication about the state of the viscera and internal milieu to brain structures (Porges, 2004, 2011). Interoception has been explored as essential to the bridging of top-down and bottom-up processing and in the investigation of the relationships between sensations, emotions, feelings, and sympathovagal balance (Craig, 2015; Farb et al., 2015; Porges, 1993; Strigo & Craig, 2016). Support has been found for the integration of interoceptive input, emotion, and regulation of sympathovagal balance in the insular and cingulate cortices, facilitating a unified response of the individual to body, mind, or environmental (BME) phenomena (Craig, 2015; Strigo & Craig, 2016). Self-regulation is proposed to be dependent on the accuracy with which we interpret and respond to interoceptive information, with greater accuracy leading to enhanced adaptability and self-regulation (Farb et al., 2015). As such, interoception is considered to be important in pain, addiction, emotional regulation, and healthy adaptive behaviors including social engagement (Ceunen et al., 2016; Farb et al., 2015; Porges, 2011). In addition, interoception has been proposed as key to resilience, as the accurate processing of internal bodily states promotes a quick restoration of homeostatic balance (Haase et al., 2016). It has been proposed that mind-body therapies are an effective tool for the regulation of vagal function, with consequent fostering of adaptive functions including the mitigation of adverse effects associated with social adversity (Black et al., 2013; Bower et al., 2014; Cole, 2013), the reduction of allostatic load, and the facilitation of self-regulatory skills and resilience of the ANS across various patient populations and conditions (Muehsam et al., 2017;

"POLYVAGAL THEORY AND MIND-BODY THERAPIES FOR REGULATION AND RESILIENCE+ Mind-body therapies emphasize the cultivation of somatic awareness, including both interoception and proprioception, combined with the mindfulness-based qualities of nonjudgment, nonreactivity, curiosity, or acceptance in order to engage in a process of reappraisal of stimuli (Farb et al., 2015; Mehling et al., 2011). While being encouraged to cultivate awareness of BME phenomena and stimuli, the individual is supported in a process of reinterpretation or reorientation to such stimuli so that insight may occur and adaptability, regulation, and resilience may be fostered (Farb et al., 2015; Mehling et al., 2011). This capacity to alter the relationship and reaction to BME phenomena is thought to be essential for self-regulation and well-being (Farb et al., 2015). It has been shown that patients utilizing mind-body therapies for healing reported a shift in both their experience of and response to negative emotions and sensations as well as the development of self-regulatory skills in dealing with pain, emotional regulation, and reappraisal of life situations (Mehling et al., 2011). Polyvagal Theory offers insight into how learning to recognize and shift the underlying neural platform of any given psychophysiological state may directly affect physiology, emotion, and behavior, thus helping the individual cultivate adaptive strategies for regulation and resilience to benefit physical, mental, and social health (Porges, 2011). As mind-body therapies affect the vagal pathways, they are suggested to form a means of exercising these neural platforms to foster self-regulation and resilience of physiological function, emotion regulation, and prosocial behaviors (Gard et al., 2014; Porges, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017; Schmalzl et al., 2015). Optimal neural regulation of the ANS and the related endocrine and immune systems is fostered through active engagement of the VVC by utilizing specific movements or positions, breathing practices, chanting, or meditation, which affect both top-down and bottom-up processes (Cottingham, Porges, & Lyon, 1988; Cottingham, Porges, & Richmond, 1988; Eckberg, 2003; Hayano & Yasuma, 2003; Porges, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017). Resilience is proposed to be fostered by both downregulating defensive states and supporting more flexibility and adaptability in relationship to various phenomena of the BME to promote physiological restoration as well as positive psychological and social states (Porges, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017). The individual can learn to improve activation of the VVC with its homeostatic influence on the organism, as well as increase the facility to move in and out of other neural platforms such as the SNS or DVC when real or perceived stress is encountered. In sum, mind-body practices can teach the individual to make the VVC more accessible, widen the threshold of tolerance to other neural platforms, change the relationship and response to SNS and DVC neural platforms that occur as natural fluctuations of the BME, and become more skilled at moving in and out of these neural platforms (Porges, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017). Breathing maneuvers within yoga often facilitate similar shifts in autonomic state, with convergent psychological and health consequences (e.g., Brown & Gerbarg, 2005a, 2005b, 2012; Brown et al., 2013). These practices may also contribute to our potential to experience connection beyond social interactions or networks and to a more universal and unbounded sense of oneness and connection (Porges, 2017).```"",",3594,"**Mind-Body Therapies and Polyvagal Theory**\n\n* Mind-body therapies focus on somatic awareness (interoception and proprioception) and mindfulness-based qualities\n* Encourage reinterpretation or reorientation to stimuli for insight, adaptability, regulation, and resilience\n* Altering relationship and reaction to BME phenomena essential for self-regulation and well-being\n\n**Effects of Mind-Body Therapies**\n\n* Patients report shift in experience and response to negative emotions and sensations\n* Development of self-regulatory skills in pain management, emotional regulation, and reappraisal\n\n**Polyvagal Theory Insights**\n\n* Learning to recognize and shift underlying neural platforms affects physiology, emotion, and behavior\n* Mind-body therapies affect vagal pathways, fostering self-regulation and resilience of physiological function, emotion regulation, and prosocial behaviors\n\n**Neural Regulation and Resilience**\n\n* Optimal ANS regulation fostered through active engagement of Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC)\n* Improve activation of VVC for homeostatic influence and flexibility in response to stress\n* Widen threshold of tolerance to other neural platforms (Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) or Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC))\n\n**Breathing Practices and Connection**\n\n* Breathing maneuvers within yoga facilitate shifts in autonomic state with psychological and health consequences\n* May contribute to experiencing connection beyond social interactions or networks, promoting oneness and unbounded sense of connection.""",1548,-56.92821369,3,,"**Mind-Body Therapies and Polyvagal Theory**\n\n* Mind-body therapies: cultivate somatic awareness (interoception and proprioception) with mindfulness qualities\n* Encourage reinterpretation or reorientation to stimuli for insight, adaptability, regulation, and resilience\n* Affect vagal pathways to foster self-regulation and resilience of physiological function, emotion regulation, and prosocial behaviors\n\n**Polyvagal Theory**\n\n* Offers insight into recognizing and shifting underlying neural platforms for regulation and resilience\n* Affects autonomic nervous system (ANS), endocrine, and immune systems through active engagement of ventral vagal complex (VVC)\n* Downregulates defensive states and supports flexibility in response to BME phenomena\n* Improves activation of VVC and ability to move between neural platforms (sympathetic nervous system (SNS) or dorsal vagal complex (DVC))\n\n**Mind-Body Practices**\n\n* Mind-body therapies: yoga, meditation, breathing practices, etc.\n* Facilitate shifts in autonomic state with convergent psychological and health consequences\n* Contribute to experiencing connection beyond social interactions or networks\n* Increase accessibility of VVC, widen tolerance to other neural platforms, change relationship and response to SNS and DVC platforms\n\n**Benefits**\n\n* Fosters self-regulation and resilience for physical, mental, and social health\n* Shifts experience and response to negative emotions and sensations\n* Develops self-regulatory skills in dealing with pain, emotional regulation, and reappraisal of life situations\n* Promotes physiological restoration and positive psychological and social states.""",1674,-53.42237062,2,bad heading,"* Mind-body therapies focus on somatic awareness (interoception and proprioception) and mindfulness-based qualities for reappraisal of stimuli\n* Cultivating awareness leads to insight, adaptability, regulation, and resilience\n* Polyvagal Theory explains how recognizing and shifting neural platforms affects physiology, emotion, and behavior\n* Mind-body therapies affect vagal pathways to foster self-regulation and resilience of physiological function, emotion regulation, and prosocial behaviors\n* Optimal neural regulation is achieved through active engagement of the Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) using specific movements, breathing practices, etc.\n* Resilience is fostered by downregulating defensive states and increasing flexibility in relationship to BME phenomena\n* Individuals can learn to improve activation of the VVC and move between neural platforms (SNS, DVC) more effectively\n* Breathing maneuvers in yoga facilitate similar shifts in autonomic state with psychological and health consequences\n* Mind-body practices may lead to a sense of connection beyond social interactions or networks and a feeling of oneness and universal connection.""",1162,-67.66833612,1,
"FIVE GLOBAL STATES AND PREPARATORY SETS+ Polyvagal Theory further proposes that the three neural circuits of SNS, VVC, and DVC are not mutually exclusive nor antagonistic; rather, these three circuits co-arise, co-exist, and co-mingle to create the complex array of human physiological, emotional, and behavioral states (Porges, 1998, 2011). Berntson elucidated coactivation and complexity in SNS and parasympathetic nervous system interactions in the doctrine of autonomic space (Berntson et al., 1991). This complexity allows for response to threat to start with a withdrawal of cardiac vagal tone before SNS activation as well as greater flexibility and precision to adjust to circumstances. The Polyvagal Theory defines five global states based on the neural platform(s) that are predominant or active (Porges, 1998, 2011). The VVC, SNS, and DVC circuits, as just described, represent three of the global states, and the other two arise from their coactivation. When the VVC and SNS circuits coarise, there is a fourth state of safe mobilization. The VVC enables the experience of safety and connection, while the SNS supports the mobilization of the body’s resources for dexterity, movement, and the quick or creative thinking needed for activities such as dance, play, artistic expression, or writing. Mind-body practices such as the postural practice of hatha yoga or tai chi are examples where the body can be mobilized for action, but the mind and breath provide the stimulus for calmness, safety, and connection. The fifth state arises from the coactivation of the VVC and DVC. These two circuits working together facilitate the state of safe immobilization. Immobilization without fear allows for the emergence of social bonds to be formed through prosocial activities such as childbirth, conception, and nursing. The concept of preparatory sets provides for a dynamic understanding of the relationship between physical posture and muscle tone, visceral state/ANS, affective state, arousal and attention, and cognitive expectation (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2015). A change to any one of these components will result in shifts throughout the preparatory set, leading to an integrated reaction by the human system in response to the needs of the environment or situation. The five global states of the Polyvagal Theory reflect a complexity of interactions throughout the preparatory set by way of the portal of the ANS, resulting in corresponding changes along somatomotor, affective, and cognitive levels (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2015). In other words, impacting the neural platforms from which an individual is operating has concomitant effects on muscle tone, visceral state, attention, affect, and cognition. Significant to this is the possibility that prolonged time in any Polyvagal Theory-defined maladaptive threat state may contribute to disorders or conditions that manifest with a combined disturbance of physiology, emotion, and behavior (Porges & Kolacz, 2018, Chapter 1). Porges and Kolacz (2018) have suggested the plausibility of autonomic dysregulation as a causative factor in irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia, both of which are characterized by altered physiology, including decreased cardiac vagal tone inferred from a lack of heart rate variability (HRV), absence of obvious tissue pathology, and oftentimes associated with a history of trauma (Kolacz & Porges, 2018). This view is consistent with the expanding body of research linked to the original CDC-Kaiser Adverse Childhood Experiences Study demonstrating strong correlation of stress and trauma history to various pathologies later in life (Felitti et al., 1998). An important insight that comes from an integrated understanding of Polyvagal Theory and preparatory sets is the necessity to investigate mind- body therapies as they were originally intended to be practiced, as integrative methodologies affecting simultaneous components of the individual’s experience (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2015). Many mind-body therapies, including yoga, call for simultaneous attention to the body, breathing, attentional and affective regulation, and cognition, thereby representing a comprehensive methodology and set of practices integrating both top-down and bottom-up processes in response to BME phenomena. It is imperative to realize that when these mind-body systems are reduced to investigate just one component, they are being taken outside the original context of their cohesive practice, thereby likely diminishing the intended combined effect. Mind-body practices teach the individual to become aware of their preparatory set, to effectively shift unhealthy patterns of response to BME stimuli within their preparatory set, and to learn healthier and more adaptive preparatory set patterns in response to BME phenomena through various techniques (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2015). Tools for self-regulation and the cultivation of resilience may develop as the individual learns the state of safe mobilization such that activation of the system does not drive out positive affective states or prosocial behavior and connection.```"",",5120,"* Polyvagal Theory: three neural circuits (SNS, VVC, DVC) co-arise and co-exist, allowing for complex human responses to threat\n*

"YOGA AND YOGA THERAPY+ Payne and Crane-Godreau (2015) suggest yoga as one mind-body practice that can shift the preparatory set. Yoga consists of a variety of practices that may serve to affect one or more components of the preparatory set by influencing muscle tone/posture, the ANS, attention, affect, or cognition (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2015). Yoga practices can be utilized to affect the ANS and to both manipulate and change the relationship to these shifting neural platforms described in Polyvagal Theory. While much of modern yoga practice focuses primarily on physical postures and movement sequences, the traditional roots are centered on a philosophical path toward understanding the causes of suffering and its alleviation (Easwaran, 2007; Mallinson & Singleton, 2017; Miller, 2012; Singleton, 2010; Stoler-Miller, 1998, 2004). To this point, work by Mallinson and Singleton (2017) highlights the variable meaning of yoga throughout the ancient texts. Historically the word yoga has been used to describe both the method of prescribed sets of practices (yoga as methodology) and the aim or goal of these practices (yoga as a state of being; Mallinson & Singleton, 2017). Yoga as a state of being includes the definition as “union,” which can mean union with one’s own essential nature or a supreme Self (Mallinson & Singleton, 2017). Other definitions of yoga include equanimity and “skill in action” (Mallinson & Singleton, 2017). Due to the variable definitions of yoga and in an effort to be nonbiased toward any one perspective, we will utilize concepts common throughout yogic texts such as the Upanishads (Easwaran, 2007), the Bhagavad Gita (Stoler-Miller, 2004), Samkhya Karika (Miller, 2012), and the Yoga Sutras (Stoler-Miller, 1998). By using concepts central to each of these texts, we will propose a framework that traverses individual lineages and helps create a shared language and understanding for yoga including relationship to current contexts. Yoga therapy is an evolving practice in complementary and integrative health care (CIH), now with accreditation for schools and credentialing of yoga therapists (see International Association of Yoga Therapists, https://www.iayt.org/default.aspx). Yoga therapy is grounded in the ancient wisdom and practices of yoga, integrated with scientific knowledge for application in current health care contexts. There are a multiplicity of ways to define what constitutes a yoga practice. As such, the heterogeneity of the practices and poor research reporting have been reported as an obstacle to the professionalization of yoga therapy (Jeter et al., 2015). An explanatory framework for yoga therapy is therefore key to the understanding and utilization of yoga therapy as a unique and distinct CIH profession.```"",",2785,"**Yoga and Yoga Therapy**\n\n- Payne and Crane-Godreau (2015) suggest yoga as a mind-body practice that affects preparatory set through:\n  - Muscle tone/posture\n  - Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)\n  - Attention\n  - Affect\n  - Cognition\n\n**Yoga**\n\n- Ancient practice with various meanings and definitions\n- Historically, yoga as methodology and state of being\n- Yoga as union: union with essential nature or supreme Self\n- Other definitions: equanimity, skill in action\n- Concepts from Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Samkhya Karika, and Yoga Sutras\n- Ancient wisdom integrated with scientific knowledge for healthcare applications\n\n**Yoga Therapy**\n\n- Evolving practice in Complementary and Integrative Healthcare (CIH)\n- Accreditation for schools and credentialing of yoga therapists (IAYT)\n- Definitions of yoga practice vary, leading to heterogeneity and poor research reporting\n- Explanatory framework necessary for understanding and utilization as a distinct CIH profession""",994,-64.30879713,3,,"**Yoga and Yoga Therapy**\n\n- Payne and Crane-Godreau (2015) suggest yoga as a mind-body practice that affects preparatory set through:\n  - Muscle tone/posture\n  - Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)\n  - Attention\n  - Affect\n  - Cognition\n\n**Yoga**\n\n- Ancient practice with various meanings and interpretations\n- Historically, yoga refers to:\n  - Methodology (prescribed practices)\n  - State of being (union, equanimity, skill in action)\n- Central concepts from yogic texts:\n  - Upanishads\n  - Bhagavad Gita\n  - Samkhya Karika\n  - Yoga Sutras\n\n**Yoga Therapy**\n\n- Evolving practice in Complementary and Integrative Health Care (CIH)\n- Accredited schools, credentialed therapists (International Association of Yoga Therapists)\n- Grounded in ancient wisdom and practices, integrated with scientific knowledge\n- Heterogeneity of practices and poor research reporting are challenges to professionalization\n\n**Framework for Yoga Therapy**\n\n- Proposed framework based on central concepts from yogic texts\n- Helps create shared language and understanding across lineages and contexts""",1102,-60.43087971,3,,"* Yoga: mind-body practice that influences preparatory set by affecting muscle tone/posture, ANS, attention, affect, or cognition (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2\n* Historically, yoga means both methodology and goal of practices\n* Yoga as a state of being: union with essential nature or supreme Self, equanimity, skill in action\n* Ancient texts define yoga: Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Samkhya Karika, Yoga Sutras\n* Yoga therapy: evolving practice in CIH, accredited schools and credentialed therapists (International Association of Yoga Therapists)\n* Grounded in ancient wisdom, integrated with scientific knowledge for current health care applications\n* Heterogeneity of yoga practices and poor research reporting are challenges to professionalization\n* Explanatory framework necessary for understanding and utilizing yoga therapy as distinct CIH profession.""",861,-69.08438061,1,
"EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR YOGA THERAPY+ Work has begun to define and establish an explanatory framework for yoga therapy and to suggest theoretical frameworks outlining the mechanisms underlying yoga-based practices from both neurophysiological and psychological perspectives (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2018). An explanatory model based on the philosophical and ethical foundations of yoga explored yoga therapy as a methodology for alleviating suffering by transforming an individual’s relationship to BME phenomena and catalyzing the emergence of eudaemonic well-being (Sullivan et al., 2018). Eudaemonia represents a state of human flourishing or sense of well- being that is nontransitory and is often connected to a sense of meaning, purpose, or self-realization (Keyes and Simoes, 2012; Ostwald, 1962). Eudaemonic well-being is linked to many health benefits such as the mitigation of gene expression changes in response to social adversity; reduction in perceived loneliness; decreased inflammation; improved immune regulation; mental flourishing; and decreased all-cause mortality independent of other variables (Cole et al., 2015; Fredrickson et al., 2013; Keyes & Simoes, 2012). Yoga has been correlated with both eudaemonia (Ivtzan & Papantoniou, 2014) and related gene expression changes found in the mitigation of the response to social adversity, resulting in decreased inflammation and improved immune regulation (Black et al., 2013; Bower et al., 2014). As such, it could be hypothesized that yoga facilitates its many positive physiological, mental, and social health benefits through its capacity to facilitate eudaemonic well-being. An explanatory framework of yoga therapy focused on its intention to promote the emergence of eudaemonic well-being with its concomitant physiological and mental health benefits is significant for both research and expanded integration into modern health care contexts for a wide variety of patient populations and conditions. ```"",",2040,"**Explanatory Framework for Yoga Therapy**\n\n* Definition and establishment of a framework for yoga therapy (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2018)\n\n**Philosophical and Ethical Foundations of Yoga Therapy**\n\n* Alleviating suffering by transforming relationship to BME phenomena\n* Catalyzing emergence of eudaemonic well-being (Sullivan et al., 2018)\n\n**Eudaemonia**\n\n* State of human flourishing or sense of well-being\n* Nontransitory and connected to meaning, purpose, self-realization (Keyes & Simoes, 2012; Ostwald, 1962)\n\n**Health Benefits of Eudaemonic Well-Being**\n\n* Mitigation of gene expression changes in response to social adversity\n* Reduction in perceived loneliness\n* Decreased inflammation\n* Improved immune regulation\n* Mental flourishing\n* Decreased all-cause mortality independent of other variables (Cole et al., 2015; Fredrickson et al., 2013; Keyes & Simoes, 2012)\n\n**Yoga and Eudaemonia**\n\n* Correlated with eudaemonia (Ivtzan & Papantoniou, 2014)\n* Facilitates mitigation of response to social adversity, decreased inflammation, improved immune regulation (Black et al., 2013; Bower et al., 2014)\n\n**Significance of Eudaemonic Framework for Yoga Therapy**\n\n* Promotes emergence of eudaemonic well-being and its concomitant physiological and mental health benefits\n* Important for research and expanded integration into modern healthcare contexts\n* Wide variety of patient populations and conditions.""",1503,-26.32352941,3,,"**Explanatory Framework for Yoga Therapy**\n\n* Research on yoga therapy's mechanisms from neurophysiological and psychological perspectives (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2018)\n\n**Philosophical and Ethical Foundations of Yoga Therapy**\n\n* Alleviating suffering by transforming relationship to BME phenomena (Sullivan et al., 2018)\n* Catalyzing eudaemonic well-being (Sullivan et al., 2018)\n\n**Eudaemonia**\n\n* State of human flourishing or sense of well-being (Keyes & Simoes, 2012; Ostwald, 1962)\n* Nontransitory and connected to meaning, purpose, self-realization (Keyes & Simoes, 2012; Ostwald, 1962)\n\n**Health Benefits of Eudaemonia**\n\n* Mitigation of gene expression changes in response to social adversity (Cole et al., 2015)\n* Reduction in perceived loneliness (Fredrickson et al., 2013)\n* Decreased inflammation (Black et al., 2013; Bower et al., 2014)\n* Improved immune regulation (Cole et al., 2015)\n* Mental flourishing (Fredrickson et al., 2013)\n* Decreased all-cause mortality independent of other variables (Keyes & Simoes, 2012)\n\n**Yoga and Eudaemonia**\n\n* Correlated with eudaemonia (Ivtzan & Papantoniou, 2014)\n* Facilitates related gene expression changes (Black et al., 2013; Bower et al., 2014)\n\n**Significance of Eudaemonic Framework for Yoga Therapy**\n\n* Research: Understanding yoga's mechanisms and benefits (Sullivan et al., 2018)\n* Healthcare integration: Wide variety of patient populations and conditions (Sullivan et al., 2018)""",1538,-24.60784314,3,,"* Explanatory framework for yoga therapy being developed\n* Suggest theoretical frameworks from neurophysiological and psychological perspectives (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2018)\n\n**Yoga Therapy as a Methodology for Alleviating Suffering:**\n- Transforming relationship to BME phenomena (bodily sensations, emotions, and thoughts)\n- Catalyzing emergence of eudaemonic well-being\n\n**Eudaemonia:**\n- State of human flourishing or sense of well-being\n- Nontransitory and connected to meaning, purpose, self-realization\n- Linked to health benefits:\n  - Mitigation of gene expression changes in response to social adversity\n  - Reduction in perceived loneliness\n  - Decreased inflammation\n  - Improved immune regulation\n  - Mental flourishing\n  - Decreased all-cause mortality independent of other variables\n\n**Yoga and Eudaemonia:**\n- Correlated with eudaemonia (Ivtzan & Papantoniou, 2014)\n- Facilitates related gene expression changes (Black et al., 2013; Bower et al., 2014)\n- Decreases inflammation and improves immune regulation\n\n**Significance of Eudaemonic Framework:**\n- Research: Understanding yoga's mechanisms for promoting eudaemonia and health benefits\n- Healthcare integration: Wide variety of patient populations and conditions""",1318,-35.39215686,3,
"YOGA’S PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION: PRAKRITI AND PURUSHA+ Yoga teaches that suffering arises from the individual’s relationship, reaction to, and misidentification with the various phenomena of the BME (Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 1998, 2004). Yoga practices are intended to teach a method of discrimination to facilitate a change in the relationship to BME phenomena and ultimately in the experience of suffering itself (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 1998, 2004). Through yoga, the individual learns the patterns of both behavior and actions that may perpetuate their suffering as well as a path toward a shift in those patterns for the potential alleviation of suffering. This process of discernment to move from suffering to a change in identification with such suffering and possibly its alleviation is taught through inquiry into the difference between material nature, termed prakriti, and spirit, termed purusha (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012). Purusha can be defined as spirit, the indweller, the observer, the seer, or that which sees, and is said to be the experiencer of material nature (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012). Prakriti is the term given to all of material nature, or all that is seen, changes, and is made manifest (Bawra, 2012; Mallinson & Singleton, 2017; Miller, 2012). The clarity that arises from this discrimination and realization of the difference between purusha and prakriti shifts the yoga practitioner’s relationship to BME phenomena such that suffering is eased and the experience of steadfast joy, or eudaemonia, may potentially emerge (Bawra, 2012; Easwaran, 2007; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 1998, 2004).```"",",1649,"**Yoga's Philosophical Foundation: Prakriti and Purusha**\n\n* Yoga teaches that suffering comes from individual's relationship, reaction, and misidentification with phenomena of the material world (BME)\n* Yoga practices help change relationship to BME phenomena and potentially alleviate suffering through discrimination and discernment\n* Discrimination involves understanding the difference between:\n  **Material Nature (Prakriti)**\n    * All that is seen, changes, and is made manifest\n    * Consists of three fundamental qualities or gunas: tamas, rajas, sattva\n  **Spirit (Purusha)**\n    * Spirit, indweller, observer, seer, or experiencer of material nature\n    * Does not change, does not interact with prakriti\n* Realization of the difference between purusha and prakriti leads to:\n  * Eased suffering\n  * Potential experience of steadfast joy (eudaemonia)\n\nReferences:\nBawra, M.

"THE GUNAS, QUALITIES OF MATERIAL NATURE+ Prakriti is said to be composed of three qualities. These three qualities, named the gunas, are said to underlie and shape the characteristics of everything that is of material nature, including the BME (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012). The gunas enable and support a dynamism in the BME, in which the fluctuations and differing proportions of these qualities give everything in the BME their unique and varied characteristics (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 2004). As mentioned earlier, the root of suffering is said to arise from the misidentification of purusha with the various phenomena of the BME, or prakriti, and more specifically with the gunas (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 1998, 2004). The knowledge and practices of yoga are intended to assist the individual in the realization that they may be experiencing the gunas, versus being the gunas. The apprehension and discernment of these three gunas is key to the realization of the difference between purusha and prakriti, thereby offering insight into the causes of suffering as well as its alleviation. The Samkhya Karika, a text representing a seminal philosophy found across the yoga tradition, as well as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, describes the gunas and their emergent physical, mental, and behavioral attributes as follows (Bawra, 2012; Larson & Isvarakrsna, 2014; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 1998, 2004). Sattva is the quality of pleasure, calmness, and tranquility that serves the function of illumination. Sattva is described as lightness, clarity, harmony, buoyance, illumination, lucidity, joy, and understanding (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 2004). The Bhagavad Gita highlights the importance of cultivating sattva as it is the foundation from which wisdom, discrimination, and clear seeing arise (Stoler-Miller, 2004). While sattva forms the base for many positive attributes, maladaptive states can also arise if one becomes overly attached to or dependent upon the quality of joy, as is briefly described in the Bhagavad Gita. In contemporary terminology, words such as avoidance, unhealthy attachment, psychospiritual crisis, or indifference have been used to describe this attempt to hold on to or maintain a static experience of sattva at the expense of allowing for the natural unfolding of the movement of the gunas within all BME and life experiences. Rajas is the quality of energy, turbulence, and pain that serves to activate. The quality of rajas is given a spectrum of emergent attributes that comes from this underlying capacity to mobilize and activate. On one end, rajas is said to support movement, creativity, motivation, and activity. However, rajas can also underlie pain, anger, greed and agitation. The Bhagavad Gita explains that because rajas obscures knowledge and clear seeing, it impedes the yogi’s capacity to discern the difference between prakriti and purusha. Rajas balanced with sattva and tamas creates the motivation and creativity for inspiring change, movement, and right action. Conversely, its preponderance may increase anger, agitation, or anxiety (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012). Tamas is the quality of inertia, delusion, and indifference that serves to restrain or limit. Tamas is explained through a spectrum of emergent attributes from this underlying capacity to restrain or limit. Theoretically, tamas may provide support for experiences such as stillness, stability, or groundedness. However, it may also foster dullness, inertia, obscuration, delusion, heaviness, negligence, or ignorance. Tamas balanced with sattva and rajas may provide form and stability, whereas an overpredominance of tamas may give rise to delusion, inertia, or obscuration (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012). The Samkhya Karika offers the metaphor of a lamp to illustrate that all three gunas work together. Just as the wick, oil, and flame work together for the purpose of illumination, the three gunas work together to reveal to the individual the difference between purusha and prakriti (Bawra, 2012; Larson & Isvarakrsna, 2014; Miller, 2012). The three gunas are in constant movement and coexistence as they commingle to create the various manifestations of BME phenomena (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012). The different proportions of sattva, rajas, and tamas in each object of material nature, including the subtle mental components of personality, cognition, emotions, and identity, give them their unique attributes (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 2004). The movement and shifting nature of the gunas are intrinsic to life as they continually rise and fall, grow and diminish. Suffering arises from either trying to stop the movement of the gunas or from our relationship with each guna—not from the guna itself. Each of these qualities can hold positive attributes in their capacity to illuminate, activate, or restrain. However, our relationship to these qualities of material nature, and any attempt to maintain one at the expense of the others, may lead to imbalance, pain, or suffering. Yoga teaches a methodology to nonjudgmentally and compassionately observe and experience the movement of the gunas such that the relationship and response to the changing phenomena of the BME is altered. The individual learns how to welcome and explore the BME in a way that facilitates eudaemonic well-being in the face of stressors or adversity.```"",",5443,"**The Gunas:**\n\n- Three qualities of material nature, shaping characteristics of everything in the BME (Bawra, 2012;

"CONVERGENCE OF POLYVAGAL THEORY WITH THE GUNAS+ Both Polyvagal Theory and the gunas provide a perspective to understand underlying foundations from which physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes emerge. Polyvagal Theory provides insight into how underlying neural platforms are activated in response to perceived threat or safety in the presence of BME phenomena. Yoga suggests that physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes emerge from and are influenced by the underlying interplay of the gunas. Both frameworks discuss the coexistence and comingling of neural platforms (Polyvagal Theory) or gunas (yoga) and attempt to convey complexity amid an inherent tendency toward reductionism within traditional academic disciplines. In Polyvagal Theory, the coexistence of neural platforms gives way to the varied experiences of play (safe mobilization) and intimacy (safe immobilization). In yoga, the coexistence of the gunas creates the varied phenomena of BME and influences the relationship and reaction to such stimuli. Both theories teach that it is from the surfacing of the neural platform of Polyvagal Theory or the guna of yoga that BME states are made manifest and established. The gunas of yoga and neural platforms of Polyvagal Theory are also reflected in one another in a convergent and analogous manner. This relationship between the two models can be seen through the comparable descriptions of attributes. When the ANS comes under the influence of one of the gunas, a distinct neural platform of the Polyvagal Theory may be activated, supporting shared characteristics between the two. Likewise, when a neural platform is activated, it supports the predominance of a guna, and the shared characteristics between them emerge. For example, when sattva reflects through the nervous system, the physiological, mental, and behavioral characteristics of the VVC manifest, or when the VVC is activated, the attributes of sattva manifest, as is described in more detail below. This discussion explores the relationship between the two models in how they relate to and affect one another for the emergence of physical, mental, and behavioral attributes. Ultimately, this relationship is meant to foster an understanding that yoga therapy may affect both underlying neural platforms and gunas, resulting in improved self-regulation and resilience for the well-being of the individual.```"",",2412,"**Polyvagal Theory and Gunas:**\n\n- Both frameworks provide insights into the foundations of physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes\n- Polyvagal Theory: neural platforms activated in response to perceived threat or safety with BME phenomena\n- Yoga: gunas influence the emergence and interplay of physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes\n\n**Polyvagal Theory:**\n\n- Coexistence of neural platforms leads to experiences of play (safe mobilization) and intimacy (safe immobilization)\n- Activation of a neural platform results in BME states\n- Neural platforms reflected in gunas in a convergent and analogous manner\n\n**Gunas:**\n\n- Coexistence of gunas creates varied phenomena of BME and influences reaction to stimuli\n- Predominance of a guna supports activation of a neural platform\n- Sattva guna: reflects through the nervous system, manifesting VVC attributes; vice versa\n\n**Relationship between Polyvagal Theory and Gunas:**\n\n- Activation of one guna influences the activation of a specific neural platform\n- Shared characteristics emerge when a neural platform is activated or a guna predominates\n- Yoga therapy may affect both underlying neural platforms and gunas, leading to improved self-regulation and resilience.""",1261,-47.71973466,3,,"**Polyvagal Theory and Gunas:**\n\n- Both frameworks provide insights into the foundations of physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes\n- Polyvagal Theory: neural platforms activated in response to perceived threat or safety with BME phenomena\n- Yoga: gunas influence the emergence and interplay of physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes\n\n**Polyvagal Theory:**\n\n- Coexistence of neural platforms leads to experiences of play (safe mobilization) and intimacy (safe immobilization)\n- Activation of a neural platform results in BME states\n- Neural platforms reflected in gunas in a convergent and analogous manner\n\n**Gunas:**\n\n- Coexistence of gunas creates varied phenomena of BME and influences reaction to stimuli\n- Predominance of a guna supports activation of a neural platform\n- Sattva guna: reflects through the nervous system, manifesting VVC attributes; vice versa\n\n**Relationship between Polyvagal Theory and Gunas:**\n\n- Activation of one guna influences the activation of a specific neural platform\n- Shared characteristics emerge when a neural platform is activated or a guna predominates\n- Yoga therapy may affect both underlying neural platforms and gunas, leading to improved self-regulation and resilience.""",1261,-47.71973466,2,,"* Polyvagal Theory and the gunas provide perspectives on the foundations of physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes\n* Polyvagal Theory: neural platforms activated in response to perceived threat or safety with BME phenomena\n* Yoga: gunas influence physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes through their interplay\n* Coexistence and comingling of neural platforms (Polyvagal Theory) or gunas (yoga)\n* Polyvagal Theory: coexistence leads to experiences of play (safe mobilization) and intimacy (safe immobilization)\n* Yoga: coexistence creates varied phenomena of BME and influences reaction to stimuli\n* Both theories teach that underlying platforms/gunas manifest BME states\n* Gunas of yoga and neural platforms of Polyvagal Theory reflect each other\n* Activation of a guna can influence the activation of a neural platform, and vice versa\n* Shared characteristics between sattva (guna) and VVC (neural platform) as an example\n* Relationship between the two models fosters understanding of how yoga therapy affects underlying platforms and gunas\n* Improved self-regulation and resilience for individual well-being.""",1146,-52.48756219,1,
"COMPARATIVE LOOK AT NEURAL PLATFORMS, GLOBAL STATES, AND GUNAS+ Both Polyvagal Theory and yoga describe three primary and combinable neural platforms or qualities from which specific physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes emerge. 1. Sattva and the VVC: Similar emergent attributes are found in descriptions of both sattva predominance and VVC activation. From sattva comes the realization of the connection between all beings. Sattvic joy is similar to eudaemonia with its more steadfast and everlasting quality and stems from calmness, tranquility, and understanding of the “Self” as in Stoler-Miller (2004). These attributes of connection, equanimity, and eudaemonia are proposed to be dependent on a neurophysiological foundation for their emergence. Halifax (2012) proposed a model where qualities such as equanimity and eudaemonia emerge only when the system is sufficiently primed and includes an axis titled “embodied/engaged” in which interoception is essential. The VVC neural platform provides support for interoception, connection, equanimity, and eudaemonia as it links awareness of bodily sensations with self- regulatory capacity; the use of facial cues and vocal prosody to communicate safety and connect to others; tuning into human vocalizations to connect with others; and the inhibition of defensive states to support equanimity, eudaemonia, and connection through the capacity to nonjudgmentally listen, observe, and be in relationship with others (Porges, 2011, 2017). In sum, through sattvic predominance and/or VVC activation, the promotion of interoceptivity, connection, equanimity, and eudaemonia may emerge. This state is well adapted for restoration, relaxation, and connection and can be maladaptive when the individual is not able to adequately respond to the needs of the environment (including threat) as described within the other neural platforms and guna states. 2. Rajas and the SNS: The attributes that emerge from rajas and the SNS are shared in their spectrum from mobilization and activation to anger or fear. The guna of rajas and the neural platform of SNS provide a common foundation for activating and motivating forces. Similar to the state of safe mobilization and play that comes when the VVC and SNS synergistically work together, when rajas co-arises with a balance of the other gunas, attributes such as creativity, motivation, optimal action, and change emerge. When rajas becomes predominant and is not balanced by the other two gunas, similar to the SNS, it provides the base for mobilization and movement in response to any demand for psychophysiological resources. This includes a spectrum from eustress to real or perceived threat in the environment, with the emergence of behavioral attributes such as fear, anger, or aggression. This continuum of mobilization includes the well-adapted response to immediate threat, or may become maladaptive, contributing to excessive allostatic load. 3. Tamas and the DVC: The attributes that emerge from tamas and the DVC provide a spectrum of experiences from stability and restraint to immobilization. In the same way the VVC and DVC partner to create internal conditions for the emergence of social bonding and intimacy, tamas can co-arise with a balance of the other gunas to manifest as stability and form. When tamas predominates, similar to the DVC neural platform, it provides the base for the emergence of obscuration, dullness, immobilization, inertia, or dissociation. This spectrum includes well-adapted responses to extreme threat or may become maladaptive and contribute to chronic disease states, which has been proposed (Kolacz & Porges, 2018). The parallels between Polyvagal Theory and gunas are further elucidated through the idea of the preparatory set. Five distinct preparatory sets stemming from Polyvagal Theory and the gunas are proposed, with their integrated patterns of muscle tone/posture, autonomic state, affect, attention, and expectation. As mentioned previously, if the underlying autonomic state is altered, there are concomitant changes throughout the preparatory set. Analogously, an alteration in the predominance of a guna from which an individual is operating may create changes in the layers of the preparatory set including muscle tone/posture, autonomic state, affect, attention, and expectation. This is congruent with the yoga therapy perspective, which utilizes an approach to evaluation and intervention that acknowledges the influence of the gunas on the physical, energetic, mental, and behavioral aspects of the individual. By including and emphasizing these underlying gunas and their effect on physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes, yoga therapy can retain its integrated and comprehensive methodology based on its foundational teachings. The outcome of this understanding is a movement away from breaking apart the practices, where asanas (postures) are directed to musculoskeletal imbalances, pranayama (breathing practices) are directed to autonomic state, and meditation or yama and niyama (intentional ethical principles) are directed to attentional, affective, and cognitive states. A more cohesive approach can be implemented for both research and clinical applications where the evaluation, assessment, and direction of intervention is toward affecting the underlying guna. The result would be an intervention consisting of yama/niyama, asana, pranayama, and meditation intended to influence the gunas and their correlated physical, mental, and behavioral states. The resultant change in gunas would have concurrent effects on all layers of the preparatory set and on physical, psychological, and behavioral well-being. In sum, both Polyvagal Theory and gunas play a vital role in understanding how yoga may help diverse conditions and patient populations by affecting the underlying gunas and correlated neural platforms. Given the complexity of living systems, this integrative yogic approach to the whole person, while still necessarily reduced for explanatory purposes, has high potential for an effect on the emergence of integrated physical, mental, social, and spiritual attributes and behaviors that facilitate well-being. These concepts also support the yoga therapist in developing evaluation, assessment, and intervention tools that are authentic to the foundations of yoga and the provision of its practices in a cohesive and comprehensive format while simultaneously assisting translation for researchers, the public, and health care contexts.```"",",6540,"**Comparative Look at Neural Platforms, Global States,

Through both top-down and bottom-up practices, yoga may be effective at downregulating the system toward parasympathetic, ventral vagal dominance (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012). In addition, the application of yoga practices for resilience of the system is discussed, as they may support the individual’s capacity to work with shifting neural platforms and gunas. Research has supported yoga’s benefits for diverse conditions such as depression, epilepsy, PTSD, and chronic pain through its influence on the autonomic nervous system and other interrelated systemic mind-body mechanisms that contribute to improved physical and mental regulation and decreased reactivity to stressful stimuli (Streeter et al., 2012). Research has also corroborated yoga’s effect on promoting vagal tone in diverse patient populations and its associated effects in decreasing allostatic load and enhancing self-regulation (Chu et al., 2017; Khattab et al., 2007; Sarang & Telles, 2006; Taylor et al., 2010; Telles et al., 2016; Tyagi & Cohen, 2016). In addition, yoga has demonstrated effects beyond physical exercise as it also concurrently benefits autonomic regulation, attention, and affect (Mackenzie et al., 2014). Furthermore, research has supported yoga’s relationship to greater body awareness, compassion, and eudaemonic well- being (Fiori et al., 2017; Ivtzan & Papantoniou, 2014). A program developed for adolescent depression included the goals of autonomic regulation, the practice of attentional and interoceptive awareness, and identification of intrinsic values to promote prosocial behavior based on yoga’s cohesive and integrative methodology and effect for regulation and resilience (Henje Blom et al., 2014). Yoga is proposed to offer methods for regulation and resilience through the integrated practice of yamas and niyamas (ethical/intentional principles), asanas (physical exercises), pranayama (breathing techniques), and meditation (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Streeter et al., 2012). Ethical intention setting (yama and niyama) informs and directs the meeting of physical and mental sensations, such as from interoception or emotions, for the promotion of positive physiological and affective states and prosocial behavioral responses (Gard et al., 2014). The ethical principles provided by yoga may help to guide the reaction, relationship, and action of the individual in response to phenomena of the BME. For example, by meeting stimuli of the BME from a perspective of nonharming, nonattachment or contentment, the individual alters the way they pay attention to such stimuli, potentially facilitating an emergence of compassion, nonjudgment, or acceptance (Gard et al., 2014). Just as Aristotle taught that virtue ethics provided guideposts for eudaemonia (Ostwald, 1962), the ethical principles of yoga elucidate a process to meet BME phenomena to facilitate the emergence of such qualities as eudaemonia. Asanas or physical postures may serve as a bottom-up regulatory tool to help regulate and promote resilience by altering the state of the autonomic nervous system (Cottingham, Porges, & Lyon, 1988; Cottingham, Porges, & Richmond, 1988; Schmalzl et al., 2015). Breathing techniques are known to directly affect cardiac vagal tone and the initiation of the vagal brake to move the system toward the VVC platform and provide another bottom-up regulatory practice of yoga (Brown & Gerbarg, 2005a, 2005b; Porges, 2017; Porges & Carter, 2017). Finally, the yoga tradition offers an array of mind-training practices for regulation, such as focused attention and open monitoring meditation (Cramer et al., 2017; Gard et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2016; Pascoe & Bauer, 2015; Schmalzl et al., 2015).```"",",4064,"**Yoga for Self-Regulation and Resilience**\n\n* Yoga practices proposed to integrate autonomic, cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes for regulation across physical, psychological, and behavioral domains\n* Effective at downregulating system toward parasympathetic, ventral vagal dominance (VVD)\n* Benefits diverse conditions: depression, epilepsy, PTSD, chronic pain, etc.\n* Influence on autonomic nervous system and other interrelated mechanisms\n* Promotes vagal tone, decreases allostatic load, enhances self-regulation\n* Concurrent benefits for autonomic regulation, attention, affect\n* Greater body awareness, compassion, eudaemonic well-being\n\n**Yoga's Comprehensive Methodology**\n\n* Autonomic regulation, attentional and interoceptive awareness, intrinsic values promotion\n* Integrated practice of yamas and niyamas, asanas, pranayama, meditation\n\n**Ethical Principles (Yamas and Niyamas)**\n\n* Inform and direct response to BME phenomena\n* Facilitate positive states and prosocial behavior\n* Nonharming, nonattachment, contentment\n* Alter the way we pay attention to stimuli\n* Emergence of compassion, nonjudgment, acceptance\n\n**Physical Practices (Asanas)**\n\n* Bottom-up regulatory tool\n* Alter state of autonomic nervous system\n* Promote resilience\n\n**Breathing Techniques (Pranayama)**\n\n* Directly affect cardiac vagal tone\n* Initiate vagal brake\n* Move system toward VVD platform\n* Another bottom-up regulatory practice\n\n**Mind-Training Practices**\n\n* Focused attention and open monitoring meditation\n* Regulation practices offered by yoga tradition""",1607,-60.45767717,3,,"**Yoga for Self-Regulation and Resilience**\n\n* Yoga practices proposed to integrate autonomic, cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes for regulation across physical, psychological, and behavioral domains\n* Effective at downregulating system toward parasympathetic, ventral vagal dominance (VVD)\n* Benefits diverse conditions: depression, epilepsy, PTSD, chronic pain, etc.\n* Influence on autonomic nervous system and other interrelated mechanisms\n* Promotes vagal tone, decreases allostatic load, enhances self-regulation\n* Concurrent benefits for autonomic regulation, attention, affect, body awareness, compassion, eudaemonic well-being\n\n**Yoga's Comprehensive Methodology**\n\n* Integrated practice of yamas and niyamas (ethical/intentional principles), asanas (physical exercises), pranayama (breathing techniques), and meditation\n* Ethical intention setting informs and directs response to BME phenomena\n* Facilitates emergence of compassion, nonjudgment, acceptance\n* Asanas: bottom-up regulatory tool for autonomic nervous system regulation and resilience\n* Breathing techniques: directly affect cardiac vagal tone, initiate vagal brake, move system toward VVD\n* Mind-training practices: focused attention and open monitoring meditation\n\n**Yoga's Ethical Principles (Yamas and Niyamas)**\n\n* Inform and direct response to BME phenomena\n* Facilitate emergence of compassion, nonjudgment, acceptance\n* Meet stimuli from a perspective of nonharming, nonattachment or contentment\n* Alter the way one pays attention to stimuli\n* Elucidate a process to meet BME phenomena for eudaemonia (happiness and flourishing)\n\n**Yoga's Physical Practices (Asanas)**\n\n* Bottom-up regulatory tool for autonomic nervous system regulation and resilience\n* Alter state of autonomic nervous system\n\n**Yoga's Breathing Techniques (Pranayama)**\n\n* Directly affect cardiac vagal tone\n* Initiate vagal brake\n* Move system toward VVD\n\n**Yoga's Mind-Training Practices**\n\n* Focused attention and open monitoring meditation\n* Regulation practices offered by yoga tradition""",2095,-48.44980315,2,,"* Yoga as a comprehensive methodology for self-regulation and resilience\n* Integrates autonomic, cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes\n* Effective in downregulating system towards parasympathetic dominance (Gard et al., 2014;

"YOGA PRACTICES FOR SELF-REGULATION: FACILITATING THE VVC NEURAL PLATFORM AND SATTVA+ As many of the beneficial characteristics of physical and mental health as well as prosocial behavioral attributes are shared by sattva and VVC, it is proposed that yoga practices may be utilized to strengthen one to affect the other. The VVC neural platform may be activated or made more accessible through practices that cultivate sattva, and sattva may become more accessible or predominant through practices that activate the VVC neural platform. The Samkhya Karika emphasizes the importance of fostering the quality of sattva through one’s habits, environment, and behavior to realize the difference between purusha and prakriti and for the alleviation of suffering (Miller, 2012). This sattvic state is taught as being essential for the clarity needed to gather insight into the individual’s relationship to various phenomena of the BME, which may lead to healthy or unhealthy responses to stressors or stimuli (Bawra, 2012; Miller, 2012; Stoler-Miller, 2004). Through the clarity of the sattva guna, the relationship to BME phenomena can be explored, and healthy relationships to both interoceptive and outer stimuli can be cultivated. Yoga therapy often first focuses on building a strong foundation of the sattva guna to strengthen discriminative wisdom, developmental clarity, and systemic adaptability and resilience. Being established in the sattva guna enables the opportunity to build positive internal relationships with interoceptive sensations, memories, emotions, thoughts, and beliefs, which may in turn support positive relationships with others. These features of sattva all benefit the self-regulatory capacity of the individual. From this sattva guna base, the individual may experience the fluctuations of rajas and tamas and change their relationship and response to these qualities of material nature, potentially facilitating resilience of the system. The VVC is a neural platform that supports physiological restoration, mental regulation, and prosocial behavioral attributes. The VVC also provides a key anchor to build the critical self-regulatory skills that lead to greater systemic adaptability and resilience. Enhancing the individual’s ability to activate the VVC is proposed as a method to retune the autonomic nervous system in disorders with a combination of diminished HRV and physical, mental, and social health deterioration, such as irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia (Kolacz & Porges, 2018; Porges & Kolacz, 2018). Both the VVC neural platform and the sattva guna correlate with the emergence of such qualities as connection, tranquility, equanimity, and eudaemonia. We propose that sattva shares neurophysiological features with VVC-mediated states, during which cardiac vagal tone is increased, and the expanded integrated social engagement system is expressed. Both sattva and the VVC may be related to states of self-restoration, interoceptivity, and the emergence of prosocial emotions and behaviors such as connection and eudaemonia. As noted previously, yoga therapy’s explanatory framework can be described as the priming of the system for the emergence of eudaemonia, with its concomitant physiological and mental health benefits (Sullivan et al., 2018). It is through the potential for eudaemonic well-being and shifts in relationship to BME phenomena that yoga therapy is proposed to help with diverse clinical conditions and patient populations. Therefore, the reciprocal relationship between the VVC and sattva, which facilitates the emergence of eudaemonic well-being, is important to the yoga therapeutic process and application of yoga practices. Building the individual’s facility in accessing and promoting the sattva guna and the VVC neural platform is proposed to be a crucial and foundational step in learning self-regulatory skills from which resilience will emerge. Through self-regulation processes, the nervous system enables healthy and more adaptive physiological, psychological, and behavioral responses and provides opportunities for greater insight into the relationship to BME phenomena to lessen and alleviate personal suffering. Healthy, adaptive physiological, psychological, and prosocial states of eudaemonia, connectedness, and equanimity may emerge when sattva and the VVC predominate. The practices of yama/niyama, asanas, pranayama, and meditation may enhance the function of the specific vagal pathways that optimize the neural platform of the VVC, and/or to strengthen the quality of sattva (Chu et al., 2017; Sarang & Telles, 2006; Telles et al., 2016; Tsuji et al., 1994; Tyagi & Cohen, 2016).```"",",4677,"**Yoga Practices for Self-Regulation: Facilitating Sattva and the VVC Neural Platform**\n\n* Sattva and VVC neural platform share beneficial characteristics for physical and mental health, prosocial behavior, and self-regulation\n* Yoga practices can strengthen one to affect the other\n* Cultivating sattva:\n  * Essential for clarity needed to gain insight into relationship with phenomena (BME)\n  * Builds discriminative wisdom, developmental clarity, systemic adaptability, and resilience\n  * Supports positive internal relationships with interoceptive sensations, memories, emotions, thoughts, and beliefs\n  * Facilitates healthy relationships with others\n* VVC neural platform:\n  * Supports physiological restoration, mental regulation, and prosocial behavioral attributes\n  * Anchor for critical self-regulatory skills\n  * Enhances individual's ability to activate the VVC for greater systemic adaptability and resilience\n* Benefits of Sattva and VVC:\n  * Connection\n  * Tranquility\n  * Equanimity\n  * Eudaemonia (self-restoration, interoceptivity, prosocial emotions)\n* Reciprocal relationship between Sattva and VVC:\n  * Facilitates emergence of eudaemonic well-being\n  * Crucial step in learning self-regulatory skills\n* Yoga practices to enhance function of vagal pathways and strengthen sattva:\n  * Yama/Niyama (ethical guidelines)\n  * Asanas (postures)\n  * Pranayama (breathing exercises)\n  * Meditation\n\n**References:**\n- Bawra, S.

"YOGA’S PRACTICES TO CULTIVATE RESILIENCE+ Promoting practices that increase sattva or activation of the VVC can create a therapeutic container to safely challenge the building of resilience. Within Polyvagal Theory, these challenges would be conceptualized as neural exercises expanding the capacity of the VVC to regulate state and to promote resilience. Yoga also includes various practices that achieve similar effects in optimizing autonomic control, providing greater physiological and psychological adaptability and resilience through reducing emotional reactivity, and lowering the physiological set point of reactivity (Gard et al., 2014). In addition to developing downregulating capacity, we believe meeting the needs of the environment requires the healthy navigation of VVC, SNS, and DVC neural platforms and their combinations. From a yoga perspective, the importance of resilience is also reflected in the model of the gunas. Just as the Bhagavad Gita elucidates the benefits of sattva, it also provides the ultimate aim of transcending the gunas through nonattachment, disidentification, and recognition of impermanence (Stoler-Miller, 2004). It is emphasized that this fluctuation and movement between clarity (sattva), activation (rajas), and restraint (tamas) is an intrinsic trait of all material nature (prakriti). Since all behaviors and neurophysiological functions are dependent on movement of the gunas, the practice of yoga is not about staying in sattva or limiting the movement of the gunas. Rather, yoga teaches a methodology to create a different relationship to the continual mixing and movement of these qualities. This underlying objective is shared with the neural exercise model of Polyvagal Theory. It is important to note that this state of discrimination between purusha and prakriti, or the gunas, is not one of nonparticipation or detachment from life. Instead, it is a state whereby the individual experiences the movement of the gunas, but the “world does not flee from him, nor does he flee from the world” (Stoler-Miller, 2004, p. 113). In other words, through yoga the individual learns not to ignore the movement inherent to BME phenomena, but to change the relationship to the movement of such phenomena. The practice is not meant to subjectively isolate oneself from the world but provides a methodology and technology to experience the world such that suffering is lessened. Polyvagal Theory provides a neurophysiological explanation of the methods and techniques embedded in yoga. Understanding and discriminating between this movement of the gunas that make up the BME and awareness, or purusha, an individual is able to experience deep equanimity, inexhaustible joy, and a sense of pure calmness even when the movement of the gunas continues (Stoler-Miller, 2004). When one learns to nonjudgmentally observe and experience this movement of the gunas, an unwavering and profound capacity for equanimity and eudaemonic joy emerges (Figure 5.1). The individual changes their relationship with the fluctuations of the BME and learns to respond and receive the changing phenomena of life differently. The practices of yoga may serve this development of resilience through the idea of safe mobilization and safe immobilization. In the state of safe mobilization, there is activation of the SNS within a container of the VVC for safe activation of the system. Similarly, within a foundational platform of sattva, the individual is able to utilize the rising of rajas for creativity, motivation or change, rather than rajas becoming a negative force. By developing an improved ability to recruit and engage the neural platform of VVC or sattva, there is greater resilience when confronted with disturbances. For example, the individual can learn techniques of setting ethical intentions, attentional control, various other types of meditation, breath, and movement to cultivate sattva and maintain the neural platform regulated by the VVC. Then the individual can assume challenging or activating postures or breath techniques that mimic the activation of the system. Resilience is cultivated by maintaining or building the facility to find calm mental or physiological states while activated. The individual is able to learn to move between guna states and neural platforms and/or to experience the combined state of sattva with rajas, or neurophysiologically promoting a neural platform that integrates VVC with SNS. By working with the qualities of rajas and tamas while maintaining access to sattva, the window of tolerance for sensation may be widened and resilience facilitated. Through maintaining the neural platform of the VVC while activating the system, as well as alternating between relaxing and activating practices, the individual may foster both regulation and resilience of the system. Thus, through the maintenance of the foundation of sattva, which provides clarity and insight while experiencing activation, the individual may find ways to change the relationship to BME, thereby learning tools of self-regulation that enhance resilience. The capacity to discern, alter reactivity, and even to hold a positive attitude in the presence of activation offers an important resource in promoting self-regulation, which may be utilized in response to stressors in the BME, including the experience of pain, illness, or disability and thereby also improving resilience both physiologically and psychologically. The yoga therapy process encourages a foundation of safety/VVC from which rajas/SNS and tamas/DVC can be experienced with greater adaptability and resilience in the broad relationship to BME phenomena```"",",5672,"* Yoga practices promote resilience by activating Sattva and optimizing autonomic control\n\n**Sattva:**\n- Increases neural capacity for regulation and promotes psychological adaptability\n- Reduces emotional reactivity and lowers physiological set point of reactivity (Gard et al., 2014)\n\n* Navigating VVC, SNS, and DVC neural platforms:\n**Vagus Nervous System (VVC):**\n- Creating a therapeutic container for safely challenging resilience\n- Neural exercises expanding capacity to regulate state and promote resilience\n\n**Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) and Dorsal Vagus Complex (DVC):**\n- Healthy navigation of these neural platforms is essential for meeting environmental needs\n\n* Yoga's perspective on resilience:\n**Gunas:**\n- Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas represent the inherent movement in all material nature\n- Nonattachment, disidentification, and recognition of impermanence (Stoler-Miller, 2004)\n\n* Yoga practice objectives:\n**Discrimination between Purusha and Prakriti:**\n- Not detachment or isolation from life but changing relationship to the movement of phenomena\n- Experiencing deep equanimity, inexhaustible joy, and pure calmness (Stoler-Miller, 2004)\n\n* Yoga practices for resilience:\n**Safe mobilization:**\n- Activation of SNS within a container of VVC for safe activation\n- Utilizing rajas for creativity, motivation, or change without negative force\n\n**Safe immobilization:**\n- Maintaining the neural platform of VVC while activating the system\n- Alternating between relaxing and activating practices to foster regulation and resilience\n\n* Cultivating sattva:\n- Techniques for setting ethical intentions, attentional control, meditation, breath, and movement\n- Building the foundation of sattva for greater resilience when confronted with disturbances\n\n* Yoga therapy process:\n**Foundation of safety/VVC:**\n- Encouraging a safe foundation from which rajas and tamas can be experienced with adaptability and resilience in relation to BME phenomena.""",2001,-64.72143865,3,,"* Yoga practices promote resilience by activating Sattva and optimizing autonomic control\n\n**Sattva:**\n- Increases neural capacity for regulation and promotes psychological adaptability and resilience\n- Reduces emotional reactivity and lowers physiological set point of reactivity (Gard et al., 2014)\n\n* Navigating VVC, SNS, and DVC neural platforms:\n**Vagus Nervous System (VVC):**\n- Creating a therapeutic container for safely challenging resilience\n- Neural exercises expanding capacity to regulate state and promote resilience\n\n**Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) and Dorsal Vagus Complex (DVC):**\n- Healthy navigation of these neural platforms is essential for meeting environmental needs\n\n* Yoga's perspective on resilience:\n**Gunas:**\n- Sattva, rajas, and tamas are intrinsic traits of prakriti\n- Fluctuation between gunas is not to be avoided but changed in relationship\n\n* Safe mobilization and immobilization practices:\n**Safe Mobilization:**\n- Activation of SNS within a container of VVC for safe activation\n- Utilizing rajas for creativity, motivation, or change\n\n**Safe Immovilization:**\n- Building the facility to find calm mental or physiological states while activated\n- Widening window of tolerance for sensation and facilitating resilience\n\n* Yoga therapy process:\n- Encouraging a foundation of safety/VVC from which rajas/SNS and tamas/DVC can be experienced with greater adaptability and resilience in the broad relationship to BME phenomena.""",1491,-73.71297602,2,,"* Yoga practices promote resilience by activating the Vagus Ventral Complex (VVC) and optimizing autonomic control\n* Polyvagal Theory explains these effects as neural exercises expanding VVC capacity for regulation and promoting resilience\n* Yoga includes practices to develop downregulating capacity and navigate VVC, Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS), and Dorsal Vagus Complex (DVC) neural platforms\n* Resilience is important in yoga's model of the gunas, which emphasizes nonattachment, disidentification, and recognition of impermanence\n* Yoga teaches changing relationship to the movement of gunas instead of isolating from the world or ignoring suffering\n* Safe mobilization and immobilization practices in yoga: safe activation within a container of VVC, utilizing rajas for creativity while maintaining sattva foundation\n* Cultivating sattva through techniques like setting ethical intentions, attentional control, meditation, breath, and movement\n* Maintaining the neural platform of VVC while activating the system to foster regulation and resilience\n* Capacity to discern, alter reactivity, and hold a positive attitude in presence of activation promotes self-regulation and improves resilience.""",1214,-78.59661495,1,
"DISCUSSION+ This chapter offers a theoretical model based on a convergent view of yoga and Polyvagal Theory, two analogous explanatory systems for understanding the function and interplay of underlying neural platforms (Polyvagal Theory) and gunas (yoga), and their role in manifesting physiological, psychological, and behavioral attributes. By affecting the neural platform or guna predominance and one’s relationship to these shifting neural platforms, or qualities, the preparatory set of the individual is altered. The development of interoceptive awareness and sensitivity fosters regulation and resilience to these shifting neural platforms and gunas in response to phenomena of the BME. In addition, the gunas of yoga and the neural platforms of Polyvagal Theory share characteristics that parallel one another where the neural platform reflects the guna predominance and the guna predominance reflects the neural platform. Yoga is suggested to provide a form of neural exercise and a methodology of working with the gunas for the regulation and resilience of the system. Through altering and/or changing the conscious relationship to the underlying state of the gunas and neural platforms described by Polyvagal Theory, the preparatory set is affected and physiological, psychological, and behavioral processes are reciprocally influenced (Payne & Crane-Godreau, 2015; Porges & Carter, 2017). Yoga practices may promote the accessibility of the VVC and the relative balance of sattva to the other gunas to assist processes of physiological restoration and positive psychological and behavioral states. Yoga practices may also be seen as helping develop facility with moving in and out of relative dominance of these theoretical neural platforms and guna states such that resilience of the system is cultivated. As an individual learns tools for self-regulation to explore and potentially alter the relationship to BME phenomena, the relationship to suffering may be improved (Figure 5.1). While we do not wish to convey that the end goal is cultivation of sattva, the theoretical correlation to the neural platform of the VVC may be seen as a neurophysiological substrate or stepping-stone toward the emergence of such states as eudaemonia, connection, or tranquility. Similarly, we are not suggesting that the other gunas and neural platforms are bad, as these energies and states are inseparable and adaptive in understanding the complexity of human experience and behavior, and thus the potential influence of a yoga therapy framework for well-being. The capacity to cultivate eudaemonic well-being is significant to yoga therapy’s explanatory framework in benefiting diverse patient populations and conditions for physical, mental, and behavioral health and well-being. The states of eudaemonia, calm, or tranquility that may emerge from the cultivation of yoga practices influences the preparatory set such that a healthier relationship to BME conditions may be learned and self-regulatory skills can be built. From a strengthened foundation of the neural platform of VVC, and the guna of sattva, the individual has the resources to move through states of dominant rajas and tamas or SNS and DVC such that adaptability, flexibility, and resilience of the system are cultivated. The practices of yoga that engage both top-down and bottom-up processes may be utilized for the cultivation of resilience by moving between neural platforms and gunas (Figure 5.1). This model may be utilized in several ways. In one practice of this model, sattva and the VVC serve as methods for self-regulation, and the practices of yoga build the tools to return to and strengthen these restorative and calm states. This is a useful practice if an individual experiences maladaptive or overwhelming states of rajas and SNS, or of tamas and DVC, and can learn to utilize yoga therapy techniques to return to sattva or VVC for clarity and calm. In another practice of this model, the individual learns to change the relationship with and widen their threshold of tolerance to both rajas and tamas, and SNS and DVC, thereby increasing the experience of safe mobilization and safe immobilization. This means that the individual learns how to find support in an underlying sattva or VVC state while other platforms or qualities of rajas and SNS, or tamas and DVC, are activated. An example is the utilization of postures or breath techniques that activate the system, while simultaneously engaging in practices of intention, meditation, and breath technique to facilitate the underlying sense of connection, calm, or tranquility. The parallel between affecting the underlying neural platform or guna state is significant in enabling yoga therapy to be practiced in a manner consistent with its philosophical foundations while being translatable to current neurophysiological thinking. The ability to utilize the existing explanatory framework provided by yoga and the gunas combined with the biobehavioral model established by Polyvagal Theory enables the translation of yoga therapy into health care and research without the need to adopt an outside neurophysiological model and attempt to fit yoga into that model. This work will contribute to yoga therapy being understood as a distinct health care profession that benefits physiological, psychological, and behavioral well-being for diverse patient populations through the cultivation of self-regulatory skills, resilience, and eudaemonic well-being. This model provides support for the creation of yoga therapy assessment tools to identify underlying guna predominance. In addition, it supports the yoga therapist in evaluating, assessing, and creating interventions aimed at working with underlying guna predominance and identifiable and measurable neural platforms toward these goals.

"IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS+ The theoretical model proposed in this chapter points to several implications and future directions. It is suggested that yoga therapy research include the comprehensive system of yoga in intervention protocols, including yama and niyama (ethical intentional practices), asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing practices), and meditation. In order to reflect the intention of yoga, the application and research on yoga for diverse populations would benefit from being directed toward such ideas as facilitating eudaemonic well-being. In addition, the targeting of yoga therapy interventions to underlying guna states or neural platforms to enhance self-regulation and resilience and their relationship to the cultivation of eudaemonic well-being is proposed, yielding several directions of future study. 1. Examining eudaemonic well-being, interoception, and indices of HRV (e.g., respiratory sinus arrhythmia) as underlying mechanisms through which yoga therapy improves outcome measures such as improved quality of life, self-regulation, and resilience, and decreased pain, inflammation, perceived loneliness, anxiety, and depression in diverse patient populations and conditions. 2. Exploring the relationship between indices of HRV, measures of interoception, and eudaemonic well-being, and their connection to physical, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 3. Testing the hypothesis of the convergence of neural platforms and gunas. It would be of particular interest to investigate whether the physiological states identified by Polyvagal Theory parallel the states and processes described in yoga. For example, is the VVC state, expressed as increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia, decreased blood pressure, and decreased catecholamines, associated with subjective experiences such as calm, equanimity, and connection that practitioners describe as sattva? Is the SNS state, expressed as decreased respiratory sinus arrhythmia, increased blood pressure, and increased catecholamines, associated with subjective experiences such as anxiety, fear, or worry that practitioners describe as rajas? Is the DVC state, expressed as decreased activity, decreased heart rate, and decreased blood pressure, associated with subjective experiences such as a disconnection from the world that practitioners describe as tamas? 4. Continued definition of the gunas and their relationship to the neural platforms and the utilization of their assessment, evaluation, and targeted intervention to facilitate regulation, resilience, and physiological, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being in diverse client populations and conditions.```"",",2732,"**Implications and Future Directions**\n\n* Proposed implications and directions for yoga therapy research based on theoretical model\n* Include comprehensive system of yoga: yama and niyama, asanas, pranayama, meditation\n* Facilitate eudaemonic well-being in diverse populations\n* Target interventions to underlying guna states or neural platforms\n\n**Implications for Research**\n\n1. **Eudaemonic Well-Being, Interoception, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**\n   * Examine mechanisms of yoga therapy's impact on quality of life, self-regulation, resilience, pain, inflammation, loneliness, anxiety, depression\n   * Investigate relationship between HRV, interoception, eudaemonic well-being, and health\n2. **HRV, Interoception, and Eudaemonic Well-Being**\n   * Quantitative and qualitative exploration of connection to physical, psychological, behavioral health\n3. **Neural Platforms and Gunas Convergence Hypothesis**\n   * Investigate relationship between Polyvagal Theory states and guna states (SNS, VVC, DVC)\n   * Associate physiological states with subjective experiences of calm, equanimity, anxiety, fear, disconnection\n4. **Gunas Assessment, Evaluation, and Intervention**\n   * Continued definition and utilization for regulation, resilience, health and well-being in diverse populations and conditions""",1324,-51.53733529,3,,"**Implications and Future Directions**\n\n* Proposed implications and directions for yoga therapy research based on the theoretical model presented in the chapter\n\n**Suggested areas of focus**\n\n* Incorporating comprehensive system of yoga in intervention protocols: yama and niyama, asanas, pranayama, meditation\n* Facilitating eudaemonic well-being in diverse populations\n* Targeting interventions to underlying guna states or neural platforms for self-regulation and resilience\n\n**Proposed studies**\n\n1. **Examining eudaemonic well-being, interoception, and HRV:**\n   * Investigating the relationship between yoga therapy, eudaemonic well-being, interoception, and HRV (respiratory sinus arrhythmia)\n   * Exploring how these factors contribute to improved quality of life, self-regulation, resilience, and decreased pain, inflammation, perceived loneliness, anxiety, and depression in various patient populations and conditions\n\n2. **Exploring the relationship between indices of HRV, interoception, and eudaemonic well-being:**\n   * Quantitatively and qualitatively examining the connection between these factors and physical, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being\n\n3. **Testing the hypothesis of the convergence of neural platforms and gunas:**\n   * Investigating whether physiological states identified by Polyvagal Theory parallel the states and processes described in yoga (sattva, rajas, tamas)\n   * Determining if specific HRV patterns are associated with subjective experiences described in yoga practices\n\n4. **Continued definition and utilization of gunas:**\n   * Defining the gunas further and their relationship to neural platforms\n   * Utilizing assessment, evaluation, and targeted intervention to facilitate regulation, resilience, and overall health and well-being in diverse client populations and conditions""",1865,-31.73499268,3,,"**Implications and Future Directions**\n\n* Proposed theoretical model suggests including comprehensive system of yoga in intervention protocols: yama and niyama, asanas, pranayama, meditation\n* Focus on eudaemonic well-being for diverse populations\n* Target interventions to underlying guna states or neural platforms for self-regulation and resilience\n\n**1.

"CONCLUSION+ Yoga therapy is proposed to facilitate eudaemonic well-being with its many effects for physical, mental, and behavioral health for diverse populations through the building of self-regulatory skills and cultivating resilience of the system (Figure 5.1). The attributes of the gunas of yoga and the neural platforms of the Polyvagal Theory, while not the same, are reflected in one another. As such, working with gunas and neural platforms that underlie physical, psychological, and behavioral attributes provides a methodology for the application of yoga practices for facilitating systemic regulation and resilience. Yoga therapy builds a strong foundation in sattva and the neural platform of the VVC for the emergence of connection, tranquility, and eudaemonia with resulting benefits to physiological, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being. In addition, resilience is facilitated through changing the relationship to the natural fluctuations of the gunas of rajas and tamas, and their counterpart neural platforms of the SNS and DVC, such that the individual learns to effectively bounce back to states of restoration and to build resilience (Figure 5.1). It is when yoga is practiced and understood as a cohesive and comprehensive system that the benefits for self-regulation and resilience may be realized. As one learns new responses to potential BME stressors, one may experience greater physiological, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being. The convergence of Polyvagal Theory and the gunas may help frame yoga therapy as a method that supports self-regulation and resilience, and lessens allostatic load through building healthy relationships to BME phenomena. When yoga therapy is applied through this perspective of shifting underlying guna states and neural platforms, the integrated nature of the practice can be understood as distinct from other CIH practices. It is hoped that this helps inform both research and health care contexts interested in integrating yoga interventions for various patient populations and conditions.```"",",2086,"**Yoga Therapy and Eudaemonic Well-being**\n\n- Yoga therapy promotes eudaemonic well-being through effects on physical, mental, and behavioral health\n- Builds self-regulatory skills and resilience\n\n**Gunas of Yoga and Neural Platforms of Polyvagal Theory**\n\n- Reflections of each other, not identical\n- Working with gunas and neural platforms facilitates systemic regulation and resilience\n\n**Sattva, VVC, and Eudaemonia**\n\n- Strong foundation in sattva and VVC for connection, tranquility, and eudaemonia\n- Benefits to physiological, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being\n\n**Resilience and Rajas/Tamas Gunas**\n\n- Change relationship to natural fluctuations of gunas and neural platforms (SNS and DVC)\n- Effectively bounce back to states of restoration and build resilience\n\n**Integration of Polyvagal Theory and Gunas in Yoga Therapy**\n\n- Shifting underlying guna states and neural platforms\n- Supports self-regulation and resilience, lessens allostatic load\n- Distinct from other CIH practices\n\n**Implications for Research and Healthcare**\n\n- Informs integration of yoga interventions for various patient populations and conditions""",1175,-43.67209971,3,,"**Yoga Therapy and Eudaemonic Well-being**\n\n- Yoga therapy promotes eudaemonic well-being through effects on physical, mental, and behavioral health\n- Builds self-regulatory skills and resilience\n\n**Gunas of Yoga and Neural Platforms**\n\n- Reflected in each other: gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) and neural platforms (VVC, SNS, DVC)\n- Working with gunas and neural platforms facilitates systemic regulation and resilience\n\n**Sattva and VVC**\n\n- Foundation for connection, tranquility, and eudaemonia\n- Benefits to physiological, psychological, and behavioral health and well-being\n\n**Rajas and SNS, Tamas and DVC**\n\n- Natural fluctuations of gunas and neural platforms\n- Learn to effectively bounce back to states of restoration and build resilience\n\n**Understanding Yoga as a Comprehensive System**\n\n- Realizing benefits for self-regulation and resilience\n- Shifting underlying guna states and neural platforms\n- Distinct from other CIH practices\n\n**Convergence of Polyvagal Theory and Gunas**\n\n- Frames yoga therapy as a method supporting self-regulation and resilience\n- Lessens allostatic load through building healthy relationships to BME phenomena\n\n**Application in Research and Healthcare Contexts**\n\n- Informs integration of yoga interventions for various patient populations and conditions""",1329,-36.28954938,3,,"* Yoga therapy promotes eudaemonic well-being through physical, mental, and behavioral health\n* Builds self-regulatory skills and resilience\n* Gunas of yoga and neural platforms of Polyvagal Theory reflect each other\n* Working with gunas and neural platforms facilitates systemic regulation and resilience\n* Strong foundation in sattva and VVC leads to connection, tranquility, and eudaemonia\n* Rajas and tamas gunas and their counterpart neural platforms (SNS and DVC) help build resilience\n* Yoga therapy realizes benefits for self-regulation and resilience when practiced as a cohesive system\n* Shifting underlying guna states and neural platforms lessens allostatic load\n* Convergence of Polyvagal Theory and gunas frames yoga therapy as method for self-regulation and resilience\n* Yoga therapy distinct from other CIH practices when applied through this perspective.""",881,-57.76605944,2,
