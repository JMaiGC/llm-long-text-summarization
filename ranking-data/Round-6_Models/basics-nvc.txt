"i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal"
"you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt to me about it okay, a friend of yours says this to you: i'm a nothing i'll never amount to anything look at... i'm an assistant clerk at 8's 45 my brother's a head of his company my sister's a top attorney and i'm a nothing okay? now, to enjoy this person's suffering we have to release ourself from two kinds of responsibility first, that we didn't cause the pain that we wanna release ourself from that especially if the other person's trying to make us believe we did cause the pain if this person had started: and you're at fault for all of this, why i'm a nothing especially when a person says that we do not want to in any way think we caused this person's pain cause you can't cause another person's psychological pain well in this case the person wasn't saying that so that's pretty easy to liberate ourself from feeling responsible but the second one is the hard one to think we have to fix it to make the person feel better the more we think it's our job to make the person feel better the more we're gonna make it worse cause you can't fix people the good news is, you don't have to there is a very powerful healing energy always available if we don't block it and how do we block that energy? by trying to fix things ourself so how do we help that energy to do the job? by empathy empathy requires presence just to be present when we are just present when we are remembering the buddhist advice: don't do something, stand there when we do that, and that energy works through us there is a precious connection between that person and us and that precious connection is what i mean by enjoyment to enjoy that precious connection and whether this person's feeling joy or pain if we are present there with them that's what i mean but we block that beautiful energy whenever we step in and think we have to fix things so we say, oh, there there you'll feel better you'll get over we make it worse when we start to give advice we make it worse so what does that look like? so you're feeling really discouraged and really would like to have achieved more in your life at this moment than you've done yes, yes, had every opportunity, and look at me i've just never made use of anything yeah, so you're really discouraged and frustrated and would really have liked to make different use of some things than you have yeah see? i'm just present not trying to fix it and when that happens there's a very precious connection that's what i mean by enjoyment and that precious connection does the healing not your advice, not your whatever "
"can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is suffering and sometimes by being there it's sort of a subtle encouragement as opposed to the subtle encouragement that i think you're talking about comes about when this person is talking about what happened to them for the fiftieth time you heard the story so, if i'm really listening to them i don't hear what they talk about the past cause i know that the more they talk about the past the less healing will take place so i interrupt but i interrupt to bring the conversation to life they're talking about the past and i interrupt then and i say excuse me but sounds like right now you're still feeling hurt because your need for respect wasn't met in that see, cause just letting them talk about the past and asking them questions about what happened about the past is to just keep the soap opera going so i interrupt when they talk about the past cause we don't heal by talking about the past we heal by talking about what's alive in us right now stimulated by the past but it's what's here now and when i connect at that level they won't keep talking about it they'll heal last question and then i'm going to get into the subject that i'd like to cover before the end"
"you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in a lot of families and the suffering that i've experienced throughout my life through my recovery and all that yes and other people were a stimulus for your suffering and you were participant in how you dealt with it for example: if you follow me in my work you would see this very clearly in places like rwanda, burundi, sierra leone i'm working with people that have had their families killed some of those people have such rage that all they live for, moment by moment, is the possibility of vengeance others have no anger have never had anger same exact stimulus they have deep feelings but not rage so it is not the stimulus that determines how our emotional reaction is that part is up to us i work with some women unfortunately a lot who've been raped and some of them feel shame deep shame some feel rage some feel other things so the same stimulus depends on how people take it whether they feel shame, rage, or other things i'm working with a woman from rwanda she heard her three children being killed cause she got... to underneath the sink hid underneath the sink in time her children didn't make it to the hiding place in time they got killed she heard them she heard her husband being killed and her brother she had to stay underneath there eleven days to save her own life cause they stayed in their house after they killed the family this woman has deep feelings but never once has she had that kind of anger that makes her wanna get vengeance she's put all of her feelings and lots of them into protecting preventing this happening to anybody else so the way she looked at it leads her to want to prevent this happening to anybody else she came to my workshop because she wanted to know how to deal with the rage toward her from other people in her tribe who are furious with her that she won't join their efforts to kill the other people same stimulus quite different reactions okay, so i had this stimulus and somewhere i learned how to deal with it in a way that i had to deal with it and i'm learning to change that now the worst thing of course would be to now matter how you did choose to deal with it is to think there's something wrong with how you chose to deal with it that not wanting us to get into one way is right or wrong I'm just saying that no matter what happens to us the other person's responsible for what they did i'm not saying the other person doesn't have responsibility that's my question about accountability that person's responsible for what they did and why they did it we're responsible for how we deal with that okay? i'm just wondering how a child becomes responsible i mean still you know the first thing i do i wouldn't wanna teach the child the lesson i just taught you until i had given that child all the empathy that child needed and i guess it would be a lot so i can see myself dealing with a long time of hearing this child's enormous pain as a result of this but then, in the course of this i would be seeing this child having some pain created by how they looked at it so i would see that they're creating pain on top of the pain by how they looked at it so, after the child had all the empathy he or she needed then i would do what i could to get them to see it in a way that wouldn't create unnecessary pain for themself this is a debut jackal, yes"
"okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get the idea that non-violent communication is solely interested in conflict resolution because it's equally interested in celebration how can we celebrate life in fact the part that i've left for ten minutes before the end is in some respects the most important part because it's where we get the fuel to stay giraffe in what's often a very jackalish world so it's gonna be pretty hard to make this radical transformation to back to our nature in many situations unless we're getting plenty of fuel now where does this fuel come from the fuel comes from celebration and what kind of celebration? comes from saying thank you in giraffe so let's see now in the last minutes how we celebrate by saying thank you in giraffe expressing gratitude in giraffe and first i'd like to remind you of how jackals say thank you: you did a good job on that paper you are a very kind person you're a good dancer can why that's jackal? moralistic judgments positive moralistic judgments are equally as violent in my estimation as negative ones mainly they reinforce the idea that the negative exist if i say you're a kind person i'm implying there's such a thing as an unkind person i'm also implying that i'm the judge that knows the difference so no more praise or compliments, okay? no more praise or compliments especially if you intend them as a reward that's the ultimate dehumanization to use thank you as a reward to say it for the purpose of trying to reinforce something to get the person to continue doing it it's like sending a... you know, what what gets on at dog obedience school? punishment and rewards giving a compliment or praise for the purpose of reinforcement is giving the dog a something to eat, to reinforce it for something people are not for that treatment and it destroys the beauty of thank you when people have to wonder - is this being said out of that energy? but it works! what does, jackal? studies in management indicate that if managers praise and compliment employees they lead production goes up studies in school show that if teachers praise and compliment students daily they work harder jackal, take another look at the research i think you'll see that that only works for a very short time until people see the manipulation and then it no longer works and it destroys the beauty of thank you because now you can not even trust gratitude without wondering whether it's being used as a reinforcement as a reward well, what about if i wanna build up the other person's self-esteem? what's wrong with that? so, you, jackal, you don't see the irony of that? what? if the other person can only like themself if you compliment them they have no self-esteem you just addicted them to your rewards that they only feel good when you say something about them they have no self-esteem okay how does a giraffe say thank you? or gratitude? first, there's three things that are involved in giraffe expression of gratitude that give us energy to keep being a giraffe the first thing in the giraffe expression of gratitude is we bring to this other person's attention concretely, what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us see, that's what we need to do, daily we need to bring our consciousness and attention to the power that each one of us has to make life more wonderful each of us is a power house we have words that have the power to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful we have touch, we can touch people in ways that can make life more wonderful we can provide services for other people we are powerhouses the more we remember this we'll not get caught up in any violent games why would we use our energy any way other than to make life wonderful when we remember that we have this power so that's one thing we gotta make clear in our expression of gratitude specifically what the person did not some vague generality for example, a woman in Geneva, Switzerland, came up to me at the end of a workshop here's what she said to me: you're brilliant i said, doesn't help she said: what do you mean? i said, you know ma'am, i have been called a lot of names in my life really, i have, some positive, and some far less than positive and i can never recall learning anything valuable by somebody telling me what i am i think there's zero information value in being told what you are and great danger - you might believe it and it's just as dangerous to believe that you're smart as that you're stupid both of them reduce you to a thing we're much more than either of those but i can see in your eyes that you want to express some gratitude yes - and i wanna receive it, but doesn't help me to be told what i am what do you need to hear? what did i do to make life more wonderful for you? well, you're so intelligent no, doesn't help doesn't help. what did i do? oh, i got you. she opens up her notebook she shows me two things that i had said she had written down she put a big star by them see, that helps me now, okay that helps me to know that somehow my saying those two things made this person's life more wonderful so that's the first thing we need to say in appreciation we need to bring to the person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful second, at the moment we're giving the gratitude to say how we feel at that moment about the person having done that so i said to this woman: could you tell me how you feel now as a result of my having said those two things? she said: hopeful and relieved oh, hopeful and relieved that gives me much more than telling me what i am that i'm brilliant just to know that somehow my saying those two things now this person feels hopeful and relieved now when i hear the third thing i'll be able to really enjoy this gratitude i said: what need of yours was fulfilled by my saying what i did that leaves you feeling hopeful and relieved? and that's the third thing we need to see in a giraffe gratitude she said: i have an 18-year old son i'd never been able to connect with him it's been very painful that we never can connect and i have needed some direction to help me connect with him those two things you said met my need for some concrete direction so, had she expressed her gratitude in giraffe she would have said, marshall, when you said these two things, showed me what the two things were it leaves me feeling hopeful and relieved it meets a need of mine to connect with my son in a way that i want okay, that's how we say gratitude in giraffe those three things"
"it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now over to where i'm going afterwards i feel very grateful because i really have a need to spend more time with my family and if i took the bus i'd have an hour less time it's nothing if you wanna terrorize a jackal, express love or appreciation to him really, if you really wanna scared jackal i've never seen anything scare jackal-speaking people more than sincere gratitude or love why do you get so nervous, jackal, when you hear it? well, i don't know that i deserved it see. jackals have this dangerous concept in their head - \"deserve\". a very violent concept it implies that you have to deserve appreciation you have to... you do deserve punishment if you behave in a certain way see the concept of deserve is a key ingredient in a violent way of life if you believe in deserve you believe certain things are worth things and you set up a very destructive economic system you'll set up a destructive correctional system very dangerous concept well, it's not the only reason why else do you get so scared when you hear gratitude, jackal? what's wrong with being humble? so, you want to, have a need for humility yes well, you know, jackal, there's different kinds of humility i'm afraid that your kind is a jackal humility i think that your kind is the kind that golda meir the israeli prime minister was reacting to when she said to one of her politicians: don't be so humble, you're not that great but the main reason that i believe that gratitude is so scary for many of us to receive is beautifully and poetically written in the course of miracles where they say it's our light, not our darkness, that scares us the most see we have been educated in this jackal way to hate ourselves to think there's something wrong with us it's a big jump, to really see what i was saying that we have enormous power to make life wonderful and there's nothing we enjoy doing more than exercising that power that's unfortunately a pretty big jump for us to come to but we can come to it so that's how we say... gratitude observation, feeling and need same literacy make sure it's coming from the heart to celebrate and never to praise, compliment, reward so any last comments or questions before our time runs up? i'm grateful for all your time and attention today"
