TEXT: ```i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal```
