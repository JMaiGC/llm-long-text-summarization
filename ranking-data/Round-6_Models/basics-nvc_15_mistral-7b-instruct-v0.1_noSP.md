TEXT: i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal [/INST]

### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

Notes:

* Enjoying suffering refers to finding joy or pleasure in someone else's pain or struggles.
* To enjoy another person's suffering, one must release themselves from two kinds of responsibility:
	+ Not causing the pain that they want to release themselves from, especially if the other person is trying to make them believe they did cause it.
	+ Fixing the person's pain or struggles, as this can make it worse and block healing energy.
* The second kind of responsibility is harder to let go of because it requires empathy and presence.
* Empathy involves being present when someone is experiencing pain or joy, without trying to fix their problems.
* By being present and empathetic, one can enjoy the precious connection between themselves and the other person, which can lead to healing and growth.
* The key concept here is that one does not have to fix someone else's problems in order to help them heal or find joy in their suffering.
* Instead, by being present and empathetic, one can allow the healing energy to work through them and connect with the other person on a deeper level.

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

**Empathizing vs Encouraging**

* Empathizing is the act of understanding and sharing the feelings of another person. It involves actively listening and trying to understand their perspective.
* Encouraging, on the other hand, is the act of motivating or supporting someone to take action or achieve a goal. It can involve providing advice, guidance, or resources.
* Sort of encouraging and supporting someone who is suffering can be subtle, but it still involves being there for them and trying to help them in some way.

**Healing through Talking**

* Healing from past experiences often involves talking about those experiences and processing them.
* However, simply talking about the past may not necessarily lead to healing. In fact, it can sometimes perpetuate the problem or keep someone stuck in their past.
* Instead of focusing solely on talking about the past, it's important to also focus on what is happening in the present moment and how those experiences are affecting us now.

**Interrupting to Bring Conversation to Life**

* Interrupting can be a useful tool when someone is stuck in their past and not making progress towards healing.
* By interrupting, you can bring the conversation back to the present moment and help the person focus on what they can do right now to move forward.
* It's important to approach interruptions with empathy and understanding, as interrupting can be seen as dismissive or unsupportive if not done correctly.

**Connecting at a Deeper Level**

* Healing often involves connecting with others on a deeper level, beyond just surface-level conversations about the past.
* By connecting at this level, you can help someone gain perspective and see how their experiences are shaping their present and future.
* This type of connection can be facilitated through activities such as therapy, support groups, or simply spending time with someone in a non-judgmental way.

**Subject to Cover Before Ending**

* The speaker mentions that they would like to cover a specific subject before ending the conversation. It's important to respect their wishes and allow them to bring up any topics they feel are important.
* This can help ensure that all necessary information is discussed and that both parties have a clear understanding of each other's perspectives.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 

Notes:

* The speaker discusses the idea that emotional pain cannot be caused by others, but rather is determined by our own reactions.
* They give examples of people who have experienced different emotions (rage, shame, etc.) in response to the same stimulus.
* The speaker also talks about their work with women who have been raped and how they deal with the emotions that come from that experience.
* The speaker discusses the idea of accountability and responsibility for actions, but also acknowledges the importance of empathy in helping others deal with their pain.
* They mention the idea of teaching children about responsibility and empathy, but only after giving them all the empathy they need.
* The speaker concludes by saying that it is important to see things from a different perspective and not create unnecessary pain for oneself.

### okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get t

Notes:

* The text discusses the importance of celebration in maintaining a positive outlook and fueling one's energy to stay true to nature.
* Expressing gratitude is a key aspect of this celebration.
* Jackals use moralistic judgments, which can be just as violent as negative ones, to reinforce the idea that negative actions exist.
* Using thank you as a reward to reinforce behavior destroys the beauty of gratitude and can lead to manipulation.
* Building up someone's self-esteem through compliments can also be counterproductive, as it can create an addiction to rewards.
* A giraffe expresses gratitude by bringing attention to specific actions that have made life more wonderful, expressing how they feel at that moment, and identifying the need that was fulfilled.
* This expression of gratitude in giraffe helps maintain a positive outlook and provides energy to stay true to nature.

### it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now ove

Summary:

* Gratitude is a powerful concept that can have both positive and negative effects on individuals.
* Jackals, in particular, may be hesitant to receive gratitude due to their dangerous concept of \"deserve.\"
* This concept implies that appreciation must be earned, and failure to do so can result in punishment.
* Gratitude can also be scary for many people because it challenges their negative self-image and forces them to confront their own power to make life wonderful.
* The Course of Miracles suggests that gratitude is our light, not our darkness, and that we have been educated to hate ourselves and think there is something wrong with us.
* To truly receive gratitude, it must come from the heart and be celebrated, rather than praised or rewarded.
* It's important to remember that gratitude is a powerful tool for making life wonderful and should be approached with humility and openness.
