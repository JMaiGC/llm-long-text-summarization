TEXT: ```i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal```<|im_end|>

### you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt 

**Enjoying Suffering: Release Responsibility and Practice Empathy**

1. **Releasing Responsibility:**
   - Not causing the pain: If someone is suffering but doesn't blame us for their situation, it's easier to release the feeling of responsibility for their pain.
   - Not trying to fix things: Avoid taking on the role of a fixer, as this can make the situation worse and block the healing energy.
2. **Empathy:**
   - Presence: Being present with someone in their joy or pain is crucial for empathy. This means not offering advice or trying to fix their problems.
   - Buddhist Advice: \"Don't do something, stand there.\" By standing there and being present, the healing energy can work through us.
3. **Enjoying Precious Connection:**
   - The enjoyment in this context refers to appreciating the precious connection between two people when they are present with each other during difficult moments.
   - Healing Energy: When we practice empathy and presence, a powerful healing energy can flow through us and help the person in need.
4. **Example:**
   - A friend is feeling discouraged and frustrated about their life achievements compared to their siblings.
   - Instead of offering advice or trying to fix their situation, simply be present with them and acknowledge their feelings without judgment. This precious connection can facilitate healing and growth.

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

**Distinction between Empathizing and Encouraging a Soap Opera**

- **Empathizing:** Listening and understanding someone's emotions and experiences without judgment.
- **Encouraging a Soap Opera:** Subtly promoting a continuous cycle of discussing past events, often leading to unhealthy patterns or negative emotions.

**Subtle Encouragement vs. Interrupting for Healing**

- **Subtle Encouragement:** Allowing someone to repeatedly talk about their past experiences without addressing the present emotions or needs.
- **Interrupting for Healing:** Actively engaging in conversation to bring focus on current feelings and needs, rather than dwelling on past events.

**Healing through Present Emotions**

- **Talking about the Past:** Discussing past experiences without addressing present emotions or needs can perpetuate negative patterns.
- **Focusing on Current Emotions:** By interrupting and redirecting the conversation to address current feelings, individuals can heal more effectively.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 

**Emotional Pain and Personal Responsibility**

- Emotional pain can be caused by external stimuli, but the reaction to that pain is determined by the individual.
- Different people may react differently to the same stimulus due to their unique perspectives and emotions.
- It's essential not to blame oneself for how they choose to deal with emotional pain, as there is no right or wrong way to cope.
- The responsibility lies with the person who caused the pain, but individuals are responsible for how they handle that pain.

**Working with Trauma Survivors**

- In working with trauma survivors, it's crucial to provide empathy and support before teaching coping mechanisms.
- Different people may experience various emotions (e.g., rage, shame) in response to the same traumatic event.
- The goal is to help individuals develop a perspective that minimizes unnecessary pain for themselves while addressing the root cause of their suffering.

**Example from Rwanda**

- A woman from Rwanda experienced the murder of her family but did not seek vengeance; instead, she focused on preventing similar tragedies from happening to others.
- Despite facing anger and resentment from others in her community, she maintained her perspective and continued to work towards a better future.

**Teaching Children Responsibility and Empathy**

- When teaching children about responsibility and empathy, it's crucial to first provide them with the necessary empathy and support for their pain.
- Once they have received adequate support, help them develop a perspective that minimizes additional pain while addressing the root cause of their suffering.

### okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get t

Summary:

Non-violent Communication (NVC) is not solely interested in conflict resolution but also in celebrating life. The fuel for maintaining a Giraffe perspective in a Jackalish world comes from celebration and expressing gratitude. In NVC, there are three key aspects to expressing gratitude:

1. Concretely acknowledge what the person did that made life more wonderful. Be specific about their actions rather than giving vague compliments or praise.
2. Share how you feel at that moment as a result of the person's actions. This helps the other person understand the impact they had on you and fosters deeper connection.
3. Express your needs that were fulfilled by the person's actions. This allows for mutual understanding and strengthens the relationship.

### it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now ove

**Gratitude Reception: A Jackal's Perspective**

1. **Jackal's Gratitude**
   - Jackals feel gratitude when their needs are met or when they receive help from others.
   - In the example, the jackal is grateful for a ride to spend more time with family.
2. **Sincere Gratitude and Love**
   - Sincere gratitude or love can scare jackals due to their belief in deserving appreciation.
   - Jackals may feel they don't deserve such expressions, which can be unsettling.
3. **The Concept of Deserve**
   - The concept of \"deserve\" is a dangerous one as it implies that appreciation must be earned.
   - This belief leads to destructive economic and correctional systems.
4. **Humility in Jackals**
   - There are different types of humility, and jackals may exhibit a self-deprecating form.
   - Golda Meir's quote about not being too humble highlights this type of humility.
5. **Fear of Light**
   - The Course of Miracles states that our light, not darkness, is what scares us the most.
   - This refers to the fear of acknowledging our own power and potential.
6. **Celebrating Gratitude**
   - Gratitude should be celebrated from the heart without the intention of praising or rewarding.
7. **Last Comments and Questions**
   - The speaker expresses gratitude for the time and attention given during the discussion.
