TEXT: ```i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal```

### can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is

To clarify the distinction between empathizing and encouraging a soap opera, we must first understand what each term entails. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It involves listening without judgment or advice-giving, which can be therapeutic for the person sharing their story. Encouraging a soap opera, on the other hand, is when one's presence or actions inadvertently prolong or intensify someone else's suffering by allowing them to dwell on negative experiences or emotions.

Now, let's break down the text into key concepts and sub-topics:

1. **Distinction between empathizing and encouraging a soap opera:**
   - Empathy involves active listening without judgment or advice-giving.
   - Encouraging a soap opera can happen when one's presence prolongs someone else's suffering by allowing them to dwell on negative experiences.

2. **Subtle encouragement through listening:**
   - When someone is suffering, being present and actively listening can be seen as subtle encouragement.
   - However, if this leads to the person talking about their past for an extended period without healing, it becomes a form of encouraging a soap opera.

3. **Subtle encouragement through questions:**
   - Asking questions about what happened in the past can keep the conversation focused on the past, which may not lead to healing.
   - This is different from interrupting to bring the conversation to life by focusing on current emotions and needs.

4. **Interrupting to bring the conversation to life:**
   - Interrupting a person talking about their past can be seen as a way to break the cycle of dwelling on negative experiences.
   - By connecting with the person's current emotions, one can help them move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past.

5. **Healing through present-focused conversations:**
   - Healing does not come from talking about the past; it comes from addressing current needs and emotions.
   - By focusing on what is alive in the person right now, one can help them move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past.

6. **Last question before covering a new subject:**
   - The speaker wants to address another topic before the end of their discussion.

To construct a Chain of Thought reasoning, we would start by acknowledging that empathy and encouraging a soap opera are two different things. Empathy involves active listening without judgment or advice-giving, which can be therapeutic for someone sharing their story. Encouraging a soap opera, on the other hand, is when one's presence prolongs someone else's suffering by allowing them to dwell on negative experiences.

Next, we would explain that subtle encouragement through listening and questions can happen unintentionally. While being present and actively listening can be seen as supportive, if it leads to dwelling on the past without addressing current needs, it becomes a form of encouraging a soap opera. Asking questions about what happened in the past may keep the conversation focused on the past rather than on healing.

Then, we would introduce the concept of interrupting to bring the conversation to life as a way to break this cycle. By interrupting and focusing on current emotions and needs, one can help the person move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past. This is different from simply listening or asking questions about the past.

Finally, we would emphasize that healing does not come from talking about the past; it comes from addressing current needs and emotions. By focusing on what is alive in the person right now, one can help them move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past. This is the key to avoiding encouraging a soap opera and instead supporting someone's journey towards healing.

In conclusion, while empathy and listening are important, it's crucial to be aware of how our presence and actions can unintentionally prolong someone else's suffering. By interrupting to bring the conversation to life and focusing on current emotions and needs, we can help someone move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past.

### you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in 

To elaborate on the topic of emotional pain and its causes, we can use a Tree of Thoughts to break down the key concepts. The first branch of thought is about the stimulus for emotional pain. The text states that \"if someone else can not cause our emotional pain,\" which implies that it is within our control how we react to external events. This leads us to consider the second branch, which is the individual's role in dealing with emotional pain. The text provides examples from personal experiences and work in conflict zones, where individuals have different reactions to similar stimuli.

The third branch of thought is about the responsibility for emotional pain. The text introduces the concept that while others are responsible for their actions, we are responsible for how we deal with those actions. This raises the question of accountability and the role of empathy in understanding one's own reactions to emotional pain.

To backtrack and construct a clear Chain of Thought reasoning, let's consider the first branch about the stimulus for emotional pain. The text provides examples from personal experiences and work in conflict zones, where individuals have different reactions to similar stimuli. This suggests that while external events may trigger emotional pain, it is not necessarily the sole determinant of how one reacts.

The second branch focuses on individual responsibility. The text emphasizes that we are responsible for our own reactions to emotional pain. This implies that we can choose how to interpret and respond to external stimuli, which leads us to consider the third branch about accountability and empathy.

The third branch is about accountability and empathy. It introduces the concept of responsibility for one's actions and the need for empathy in understanding one's own reactions to emotional pain. This raises the question of how we can teach children to deal with emotional pain without creating additional suffering.

To address this, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where a child is dealing with emotional pain caused by external events. The text suggests that before teaching the child about responsibility and empathy, one would first provide empathetic support to help the child process their pain. This implies that empathy is a prerequisite for understanding one's own reactions and taking responsibility for them.

In summary, the Tree of Thoughts reveals that emotional pain has multiple causes, including external stimuli and individual interpretations. It also highlights the importance of personal accountability and empathy in dealing with emotional pain. Backtracking through these thoughts allows us to construct a clear Chain of Thought reasoning that emphasizes the role of choice and responsibility in managing emotional pain.

### okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get t

1. The first thing we need to do is bring to this other person's attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. This involves being specific about the actions taken by the other person and how they contributed to making our lives better.
2. Next, at the moment of expressing gratitude, we should say how we feel at that moment about the person having done those things. This helps the recipient understand the impact their actions have had on us emotionally.
3. Finally, we need to see in a giraffe gratitude the third thing: what need of ours was fulfilled by the other person's actions? This is crucial because it shows how our gratitude is not just about praising someone but also about recognizing and appreciating their contribution to meeting our needs.
4. By being specific, honest, and acknowledging the impact on our emotions and needs, we can express genuine gratitude in a way that is meaningful and energizing for both parties involved.

### it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now ove

To elaborate on the topic of gratitude, let us consider a Tree of Thoughts. The root of this tree is the concept of gratitude itself, which can be divided into two main branches: how we receive gratitude and how we express it.

The first branch, how we receive gratitude, is further subdivided into two sub-branches: the nature of gratitude and the impact of receiving it. The nature of gratitude encompasses the concept of \"deserve,\" which is a dangerous idea that can lead to a violent way of life. It also includes the notion of humility, which can be either healthy or unhealthy depending on its source.

The second branch, how we express gratitude, is further subdivided into two sub-branches: the expression itself and the impact of expressing it. The expression of gratitude can take various forms, such as sincere appreciation or love, which can have a profound effect on both the giver and the receiver.

Backtracking to the root concept of gratitude, we find that it is not only about receiving or giving but also about our relationship with ourselves. Gratitude can be seen as a way to celebrate life and acknowledge our own power to make it better. It is a form of self-love that can help us overcome the darkness within and embrace our light.

In summary, gratitude is a complex concept that involves both how we receive and express it. It is deeply connected to our relationship with ourselves and others, and it has the potential to transform our lives from one of violence and self-loathing to one of love and celebration.
