i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal	5107	 **Topic:** Communication Strategies for Managing Conflicts with Intimate Partner\n\n**Key Concepts:** Empathy, Active Listening, Clear Communication, Misunderstandings\n\n**Background:** The speaker is discussing communication issues in their relationship and the importance of empathy, active listening, clear communication, and avoiding misunderstandings.\n\n**Empathy:**\n- Empathy is essential when trying to change someone's behavior (even in extreme cases like prison inmates)\n- Start by understanding their needs and motivations\n- Show them that their behavior is precious and important to you\n\n**Clear Communication:**\n- Be honest about your feelings and needs\n- Use \I\" statements instead of accusatory language\n- Encourage the other person to share their perspective\n- Validate their feelings and needs\n\n**Misunderstandings:**\n- Misunderstandings can lead to arguments and conflict\n- Avoid assuming that the other person's reaction is based on what you said\n- Use active listening skills to clarify misunderstandings\n- Acknowledge and validate their perspective, even if it differs from yours\n\n**Specific Situation:**\n- The speaker and their partner argue frequently when they get together\n- The speaker wants the partner to be happy but feels that just being told to \"be happy\" is not helpful\n- The partner often tries to control the speaker's plans, which causes anxiety\n\n**Strategies for Handling Specific Situation:**\n- Instead of telling the partner to be happy, identify specific actions they can take to feel more confident and in control\n- When the partner is in a bad mood, empathize with their feelings instead of demanding that they change their mood to suit the speaker\n- When planning a trip, find a way to communicate clearly about the speaker's need for independence while also acknowledging the partner's concern for their wellbeing.\n\n**Quotes:**\n- \"Just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind.\"\n- \"Empathy starts by empathizing with what mother's intent in behaving as she does.\"\n- \"I'd like you to hear it differently, I'd like you to just hear my needs.\"\n- \"Just about three ear-pulls and I got it right?

you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes that's very important thank you for being in debt to me about it okay, a friend of yours says this to you: i'm a nothing i'll never amount to anything look at... i'm an assistant clerk at 8's 45 my brother's a head of his company my sister's a top attorney and i'm a nothing okay? now, to enjoy this person's suffering we have to release ourself from two kinds of responsibility first, that we didn't cause the pain that we wanna release ourself from that especially if the other person's trying to make us believe we did cause the pain if this person had started: and you're at fault for all of this, why i'm a nothing especially when a person says that we do not want to in any way think we caused this person's pain cause you can't cause another person's psychological pain well in this case the person wasn't saying that so that's pretty easy to liberate ourself from feeling responsible but the second one is the hard one to think we have to fix it to make the person feel better the more we think it's our job to make the person feel better the more we're gonna make it worse cause you can't fix people the good news is, you don't have to there is a very powerful healing energy always available if we don't block it and how do we block that energy? by trying to fix things ourself so how do we help that energy to do the job? by empathy empathy requires presence just to be present when we are just present when we are remembering the buddhist advice: don't do something, stand there when we do that, and that energy works through us there is a precious connection between that person and us and that precious connection is what i mean by enjoyment to enjoy that precious connection and whether this person's feeling joy or pain if we are present there with them that's what i mean but we block that beautiful energy whenever we step in and think we have to fix things so we say, oh, there there you'll feel better you'll get over we make it worse when we start to give advice we make it worse so what does that look like? so you're feeling really discouraged and really would like to have achieved more in your life at this moment than you've done yes, yes, had every opportunity, and look at me i've just never made use of anything yeah, so you're really discouraged and frustrated and would really have liked to make different use of some things than you have yeah see? i'm just present not trying to fix it and when that happens there's a very precious connection that's what i mean by enjoyment and that precious connection does the healing not your advice, not your whatever 	2688	 **Topic:** Enjoying Suffering: Releasing Responsibility and Embracing Empathy\n\n**Key Concept:** The ability to enjoy suffering involves releasing oneself from two kinds of responsibility: the belief that one caused another person's pain and the feeling that it is one's duty to fix their pain.\n\n**Releasing Responsibility:**\n\n* **Not causing the pain:** In this scenario, a friend expresses feelings of inadequacy compared to others. To enjoy their suffering, one must first release oneself from the responsibility of having caused their pain. Since the friend did not accuse the listener of being at fault, it is easy for the listener to let go of this feeling.\n* **Not responsible for fixing the pain:** The second and more challenging aspect is recognizing that it is not one's duty to fix another person's pain. When someone expresses their suffering, there can be a natural inclination to want to help or offer solutions. However, attempting to do so may actually worsen the situation.\n\n**Empathy and Healing:**\n\n* **Presence and empathy:** To help the healing process, one should focus on being present with the person in their suffering. This means listening attentively without judgment or offering unsolicited advice. By simply being there for them, a precious connection is formed, which is what the speaker refers to as \enjoyment.\"\n* **Healing energy:** There is a powerful healing energy that can work through us when we are present with someone in their suffering. This energy cannot be harnessed when one tries to fix things or offer solutions. Instead, it flows more freely when we allow ourselves to empathize and connect with the person on a deeper level.\n* **Blocking the energy:** We block this healing energy by trying to fix things or give advice. When we step in and attempt to \"help,\" we may unintentionally make things worse. By being present and allowing the person to process their emotions, we create an environment for the natural healing process to occur.\n* **Example:** In the given scenario, if someone expresses feelings of discouragement and frustration about not achieving more in life, simply being present with them without trying to offer solutions or advice can lead to a precious connection that facilitates healing."	2275	16	3	 1.

Understanding suffering: The text discusses the idea of enjoying someone's suffering by understanding that we must release ourselves from two types of responsibility - not causing the pain and not being responsible for fixing it.\n\n2. Causing psychological pain: It is crucial to remember that we cannot cause another person's psychological pain, as this can lead to a misguided sense of responsibility.\n\n3. Empathy and presence: To help someone in pain, we must be empathetic and present without trying to fix their problems. This allows the healing energy to work through us and create a precious connection with the person in need.\n\n4. Blocking the healing energy: We often block this powerful healing energy by attempting to fix things ourselves, which can make the situation worse.\n\n5. The role of advice: Offering advice or trying to provide solutions can hinder the healing process and weaken the precious connection between individuals.

can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is suffering and sometimes by being there it's sort of a subtle encouragement as opposed to the subtle encouragement that i think you're talking about comes about when this person is talking about what happened to them for the fiftieth time you heard the story so, if i'm really listening to them i don't hear what they talk about the past cause i know that the more they talk about the past the less healing will take place so i interrupt but i interrupt to bring the conversation to life they're talking about the past and i interrupt then and i say excuse me but sounds like right now you're still feeling hurt because your need for respect wasn't met in that see, cause just letting them talk about the past and asking them questions about what happened about the past is to just keep the soap opera going so i interrupt when they talk about the past cause we don't heal by talking about the past we heal by talking about what's alive in us right now stimulated by the past but it's what's here now and when i connect at that level they won't keep talking about it they'll heal last question and then i'm going to get into the subject that i'd like to cover before the end	1324	 **Empathizing vs. Encouraging and Supporting:**\n\n- Empathizing refers to understanding and sharing another person's feelings and experiences.\n- Encouraging and supporting someone who is suffering can take different forms.\n- Subtle encouragement in the context of this text refers to listening attentively and providing emotional support.\n\n**Listening vs. Keeping the Soap Opera Going:**\n\n- Listening to someone's story about their past experiences is a form of empathizing and supporting.\n- However, if the person keeps repeating the same story without making progress towards healing, it can be considered keeping the \soap opera\" going.\n- This can hinder the healing process as the person becomes stuck in the past.\n\n**Interrupting vs. Healing:**\n\n- Interrupting someone while they are talking about their past experiences may seem counterintuitive to empathizing and supporting.\n- However, interrupting can be an effective way to bring the conversation to the present moment and stimulate healing.\n- By acknowledging the emotions underlying the story and focusing on what is alive in the person now, they are less likely to keep dwelling on the past.\n\n**Healing through Present Moment Connection:**\n\n- Healing does not come from talking about the past endlessly.\n- Instead, healing occurs when we connect with what is alive in us in the present moment, which can be stimulated by the past experiences.\n- By interrupting and bringing the conversation to the present moment, the person can begin to heal."	1530	10	3	 Summary:\n\n\n- Empathyzing vs. Encouraging: Clarifying the Difference\n \n  - Empathizing is a subtle encouragement towards someone who is suffering, while encouraging is more direct support and active listening.\n- The distinction between empathizing and encouraging can be seen in how we listen to someone's story of past experiences.\n- Encouraging focuses on the present, not past, as it helps healing happens when talking about what's alive now rather than past.\n- Interrupting conversations about past is important to avoid keeping the \soap opera\" going and encourage healing.\n- Asking questions about past can keep the conversation going but interrupting to bring focus on present and healing.\n- Focusing on present helps healing, not past experiences."	767	5	1	**Distinction between Empathizing and Encouraging/Supporting**\n\n- **Empathizing:** Understanding and sharing the feelings of another person.\n- **Encouraging/Supporting:** Providing comfort, reassurance, or motivation to someone who is suffering.\n\n**Subtle Encouragement vs. Keeping the Soap Opera Going**\n\n- **Subtle Encouragement (Negative):** Allowing a person to repeatedly talk about their past suffering without addressing the present emotions. This keeps the focus on the past and prevents healing.\n- **Interrupting and Bringing Conversation to Life:** By interrupting when someone talks about the past, one can redirect the conversation towards current emotions stimulated by the past. This encourages healing and growth in the present moment.\n\n**Healing through Present Emotions**\n\n- **Talking about the Past:** Discussing past events without addressing the emotions they evoke keeps the focus on the past and does not contribute to healing.\n- **Focusing on Current Emotions:** By connecting with someone at the level of their present emotions, one can help them heal from past experiences. This involves interrupting when necessary and redirecting the conversation towards what is alive in the person right now.	1233	14	3	**Distinction between Empathizing and Encouraging a Soap Opera**\n\n- **Empathizing:** Listening and understanding someone's emotions and experiences without judgment.\n- **Encouraging a Soap Opera:** Subtly promoting a continuous cycle of discussing past events, often leading to unhealthy patterns or negative emotions.\n\n**Subtle Encouragement vs. Interrupting for Healing**\n\n- **Subtle Encouragement:** Allowing someone to repeatedly talk about their past experiences without addressing the present emotions or needs.\n- **Interrupting for Healing:** Actively engaging in conversation to bring focus on current feelings and needs, rather than dwelling on past events.\n\n**Healing through Present Emotions**\n\n- **Talking about the Past:** Discussing past experiences without addressing present emotions or needs can perpetuate negative patterns.\n- **Focusing on Current Emotions:** By interrupting and redirecting the conversation to address current feelings, individuals can heal more effectively.	1008	12	3	**Distinction between Empathizing, Encouraging, and Supporting**\n\n1. **Empathy**: Understanding another person's feelings or experiences without necessarily agreeing with them. It involves active listening and acknowledging their emotions.\n2. **Encouragement**: Providing support and motivation to help someone feel more confident in themselves or their abilities. This can be done by offering positive feedback, praise, or reassurance.\n3. **Support**: Offering assistance, guidance, or resources to help someone navigate through a difficult situation or overcome challenges.\n\n**Soap Opera vs. Healing Conversation**\n\n1. **Soap Opera**: A continuous cycle of talking about the past without moving forward in the healing process. It can be unproductive and keep individuals stuck in their problems.\n2. **Healing Conversation**: A conversation that focuses on the present emotions and experiences, stimulated by the past but centered around what is happening now. This type of discussion promotes growth and healing.\n\n**Strategies for Healing Conversations**\n\n1. **Active Listening**: Pay attention to the person's feelings and needs without judgment or interruption.\n2. **Interrupting Past-Focused Talks**: When someone is talking about the past, interrupt gently to redirect the conversation towards the present emotions and experiences.\n3. **Connect at a Deeper Level**: Focus on what is alive in the person right now, stimulated by their past experiences. This helps them feel understood and validated.\n4. **Encourage Healing**: Help the individual identify their strengths and resources to overcome challenges, rather than dwelling on the past.\n5. **Balance Empathy with Action**: While empathy is essential for understanding someone's feelings, it is also crucial to offer support and guidance to help them move forward in their healing journey.\n<|im_end|>	1878	21	3	**Distinction between Empathizing, Encouraging, and Supporting**\n1. Empathy: Understanding someone's feelings or situation without necessarily encouraging them to continue discussing their past experiences.\n2. Encouragement: Subtly promoting the continuation of a story or conversation about the past.\n3. Support: Providing emotional assistance while focusing on the present and future healing process.\n\n**Healing Process and Conversation Interruption**\n1. Past-focused conversations: Keeping the focus on past events may not lead to significant healing, as it can prolong the suffering.\n2. Present-focused approach: Encouraging individuals to discuss their feelings and experiences in relation to the present moment, stimulated by past events, promotes healing.\n3. Interrupting conversations: By interrupting when someone is talking about the past, the listener can redirect the conversation towards the present emotions and needs, ultimately fostering a more effective healing process.\n4. Moving forward: Addressing the current situation and feelings stimulated by past experiences allows individuals to heal and grow, rather than dwelling on the past.\n5.

you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in a lot of families and the suffering that i've experienced throughout my life through my recovery and all that yes and other people were a stimulus for your suffering and you were participant in how you dealt with it for example: if you follow me in my work you would see this very clearly in places like rwanda, burundi, sierra leone i'm working with people that have had their families killed some of those people have such rage that all they live for, moment by moment, is the possibility of vengeance others have no anger have never had anger same exact stimulus they have deep feelings but not rage so it is not the stimulus that determines how our emotional reaction is that part is up to us i work with some women unfortunately a lot who've been raped and some of them feel shame deep shame some feel rage some feel other things so the same stimulus depends on how people take it whether they feel shame, rage, or other things i'm working with a woman from rwanda she heard her three children being killed cause she got... to underneath the sink hid underneath the sink in time her children didn't make it to the hiding place in time they got killed she heard them she heard her husband being killed and her brother she had to stay underneath there eleven days to save her own life cause they stayed in their house after they killed the family this woman has deep feelings but never once has she had that kind of anger that makes her wanna get vengeance she's put all of her feelings and lots of them into protecting preventing this happening to anybody else so the way she looked at it leads her to want to prevent this happening to anybody else she came to my workshop because she wanted to know how to deal with the rage toward her from other people in her tribe who are furious with her that she won't join their efforts to kill the other people same stimulus quite different reactions okay, so i had this stimulus and somewhere i learned how to deal with it in a way that i had to deal with it and i'm learning to change that now the worst thing of course would be to now matter how you did choose to deal with it is to think there's something wrong with how you chose to deal with it that not wanting us to get into one way is right or wrong I'm just saying that no matter what happens to us the other person's responsible for what they did i'm not saying the other person doesn't have responsibility that's my question about accountability that person's responsible for what they did and why they did it we're responsible for how we deal with that okay? i'm just wondering how a child becomes responsible i mean still you know the first thing i do i wouldn't wanna teach the child the lesson i just taught you until i had given that child all the empathy that child needed and i guess it would be a lot so i can see myself dealing with a long time of hearing this child's enormous pain as a result of this but then, in the course of this i would be seeing this child having some pain created by how they looked at it so i would see that they're creating pain on top of the pain by how they looked at it so, after the child had all the empathy he or she needed then i would do what i could to get them to see it in a way that wouldn't create unnecessary pain for themself this is a debut jackal, yes	3461	 **Emotional Pain and Stimuli**\n\n- The ability of someone else to cause emotional pain is not absolute as individuals have control over their own reactions.\n- Personal experiences and family background shape emotional responses.\n- Different people react differently to the same stimulus.\n\n**Examples from Work Experience**\n\n- In Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone:\n  - Some individuals harbor deep rage and live for vengeance.\n  - Others have no anger despite similar experiences.\n\n**Individual Responsibility vs. Accountability**\n\n- Individuals are responsible for their emotional reactions to stimuli.\n- The person causing harm is accountable for their actions.\n\n**Working with Trauma Survivors**\n\n- Different reactions to trauma:\n  - Rage and vengeance.\n  - Deep shame.\n  - Other emotions.\n- Empathy and understanding are crucial before teaching coping mechanisms.\n- Helping individuals change their perspective to minimize unnecessary pain.\n\n**The Concept of Debt Jackal**\n\n- A term used in the context of emotional healing.\n- Refers to the inner voice that tells us we owe others for their suffering or our own.\n- Encourages individuals to take on unnecessary guilt and responsibility, creating more pain.	1239	9	2	1.

Stimulus vs. Emotional Reaction: The speaker emphasizes that the stimulus alone does not determine how we react emotionally; it is up to us how we deal with it.\n2. Different Reactions to Similar Stimuli: Examples from Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone showcase how people respond differently to traumatic events despite similar circumstances.\n3. Personal Responsibility in Dealing with Emotional Pain: The speaker highlights the importance of taking responsibility for our own emotional reactions rather than blaming others or external factors.\n4. Accountability and Empathy: While acknowledging that individuals are responsible for their actions, the speaker also emphasizes empathy as a crucial factor in understanding and dealing with emotional pain.\n5. Teaching Children Responsibility: The speaker suggests providing children with empathy before teaching them how to deal with emotional pain, ensuring they don't create unnecessary suffering for themselves.\n\n**Key Concepts:** Emotional Pain, Personal Responsibility, Accountability, Empathy, Stimulus, Reaction, Dealing with Trauma, Children's Development	1161	19	2	Summary: Emotional reactions are influenced by both external stimuli and individual responses. The speaker discusses various examples of suffering and emotional reactions in different situations. They emphasize that the same stimulus can lead to diverse feelings, such as shame, rage, or other emotions. People have varying ways of coping with their experiences, and it is essential not to judge these methods as right or wrong. Accountability for one's actions and empathy are crucial in understanding and addressing emotional pain. The speaker also mentions the importance of teaching children empathy before guiding them towards healthier perspectives on their experiences to prevent creating additional unnecessary pain. This approach aims to help individuals navigate complex emotions and foster a more compassionate outlook on life's challenges.\n\nKey Concepts: Emotional reactions, stimuli, individual responses, accountability, empathy, coping mechanisms, teaching children, understanding pain.\n<|im_end|>	1015	15	1
okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get the idea that non-violent communication is solely interested in conflict resolution because it's equally interested in celebration how can we celebrate life in fact the part that i've left for ten minutes before the end is in some respects the most important part because it's where we get the fuel to stay giraffe in what's often a very jackalish world so it's gonna be pretty hard to make this radical transformation to back to our nature in many situations unless we're getting plenty of fuel now where does this fuel come from the fuel comes from celebration and what kind of celebration? comes from saying thank you in giraffe so let's see now in the last minutes how we celebrate by saying thank you in giraffe expressing gratitude in giraffe and first i'd like to remind you of how jackals say thank you: you did a good job on that paper you are a very kind person you're a good dancer can why that's jackal? moralistic judgments positive moralistic judgments are equally as violent in my estimation as negative ones mainly they reinforce the idea that the negative exist if i say you're a kind person i'm implying there's such a thing as an unkind person i'm also implying that i'm the judge that knows the difference so no more praise or compliments, okay? no more praise or compliments especially if you intend them as a reward that's the ultimate dehumanization to use thank you as a reward to say it for the purpose of trying to reinforce something to get the person to continue doing it it's like sending a... you know, what what gets on at dog obedience school? punishment and rewards giving a compliment or praise for the purpose of reinforcement is giving the dog a something to eat, to reinforce it for something people are not for that treatment and it destroys the beauty of thank you when people have to wonder - is this being said out of that energy? but it works! what does, jackal? studies in management indicate that if managers praise and compliment employees they lead production goes up studies in school show that if teachers praise and compliment students daily they work harder jackal, take another look at the research i think you'll see that that only works for a very short time until people see the manipulation and then it no longer works and it destroys the beauty of thank you because now you can not even trust gratitude without wondering whether it's being used as a reinforcement as a reward well, what about if i wanna build up the other person's self-esteem? what's wrong with that? so, you, jackal, you don't see the irony of that? what? if the other person can only like themself if you compliment them they have no self-esteem you just addicted them to your rewards that they only feel good when you say something about them they have no self-esteem okay how does a giraffe say thank you? or gratitude? first, there's three things that are involved in giraffe expression of gratitude that give us energy to keep being a giraffe the first thing in the giraffe expression of gratitude is we bring to this other person's attention concretely, what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us see, that's what we need to do, daily we need to bring our consciousness and attention to the power that each one of us has to make life more wonderful each of us is a power house we have words that have the power to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful we have touch, we can touch people in ways that can make life more wonderful we can provide services for other people we are powerhouses the more we remember this we'll not get caught up in any violent games why would we use our energy any way other than to make life wonderful when we remember that we have this power so that's one thing we gotta make clear in our expression of gratitude specifically what the person did not some vague generality for example, a woman in Geneva, Switzerland, came up to me at the end of a workshop here's what she said to me: you're brilliant i said, doesn't help she said: what do you mean? i said, you know ma'am, i have been called a lot of names in my life really, i have, some positive, and some far less than positive and i can never recall learning anything valuable by somebody telling me what i am i think there's zero information value in being told what you are and great danger - you might believe it and it's just as dangerous to believe that you're smart as that you're stupid both of them reduce you to a thing we're much more than either of those but i can see in your eyes that you want to express some gratitude yes - and i wanna receive it, but doesn't help me to be told what i am what do you need to hear? what did i do to make life more wonderful for you? well, you're so intelligent no, doesn't help doesn't help. what did i do? oh, i got you. she opens up her notebook she shows me two things that i had said she had written down she put a big star by them see, that helps me now, okay that helps me to know that somehow my saying those two things made this person's life more wonderful so that's the first thing we need to say in appreciation we need to bring to the person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful second, at the moment we're giving the gratitude to say how we feel at that moment about the person having done that so i said to this woman: could you tell me how you feel now as a result of my having said those two things? she said: hopeful and relieved oh, hopeful and relieved that gives me much more than telling me what i am that i'm brilliant just to know that somehow my saying those two things now this person feels hopeful and relieved now when i hear the third thing i'll be able to really enjoy this gratitude i said: what need of yours was fulfilled by my saying what i did that leaves you feeling hopeful and relieved? and that's the third thing we need to see in a giraffe gratitude she said: i have an 18-year old son i'd never been able to connect with him it's been very painful that we never can connect and i have needed some direction to help me connect with him those two things you said met my need for some concrete direction so, had she expressed her gratitude in giraffe she would have said, marshall, when you said these two things, showed me what the two things were it leaves me feeling hopeful and relieved it meets a need of mine to connect with my son in a way that i want okay, that's how we say gratitude in giraffe those three things	6632	 **Non-Violent Communication (NVC) and Celebration**\n\n* NVC is not only about conflict resolution but also about celebration and expressing gratitude\n* Celebration provides fuel to stay true to our nature in a \jackalish\" world\n* Fuel comes from saying thank you in the form of genuine expression of gratitude\n\n**Jackals and Praise/Compliments**\n\n* Jackals use praise/compliments as moralistic judgments and rewards\n* Reinforces the idea that negative exists and implies the speaker is the judge\n* Destroys the beauty of thank you when used as a manipulation tool\n* Studies on praise in management and education show short-term effects\n\n**Giraffe's Expression of Gratitude**\n\n* Bring to person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful\n\t+ Concrete example of the impact on our lives\n\t+ Avoid vague generality or telling someone what they are\n* Share how we feel at that moment about the person having done that\n* Identify the need of the person that was fulfilled by our actions\n\n**Examples of Giraffe Gratitude**\n\n* A woman in Geneva, Switzerland, expressing gratitude to Marshall:\n\t+ Concrete example: what I did\n\t+ Share feelings: hopeful and relieved\n\t+ Identify need: direction to connect with her son"	1264	11	3	 1.

Jackal's View on Praise and Compliments\n   - Jackals use praise and compliments as moralistic judgments, which can be just as violent as negative ones.\n   - They often reinforce the idea that there is a right and wrong way to behave or act.\n3. The Dangers of Using Praise and Compliments\n   - When used as rewards or reinforcements, praise and compliments can lead to manipulation and loss of trust in genuine gratitude.\n   - They may also contribute to low self-esteem by making individuals dependent on external validation.\n4. Giraffe's Expression of Gratitude\n   - A giraffe's expression of gratitude involves three key elements:\n     a) Concrete acknowledgment of the specific actions that made life more wonderful for the receiver.\n     b) Sharing how the receiver feels at that moment as a result of the other person's actions.\n     c) Identifying the need fulfilled by those actions, which led to the feelings experienced by the receiver."	1222	33	3	Summary:\n\nNon-violent Communication (NVC) is not solely interested in conflict resolution but also in celebrating life. The fuel for maintaining a Giraffe perspective in a Jackalish world comes from celebration and expressing gratitude. In NVC, there are three key aspects to expressing gratitude:\n\n1. Concretely acknowledge what the person did that made life more wonderful. Be specific about their actions rather than giving vague compliments or praise.\n2. Share how you feel at that moment as a result of the person's actions. This helps the other person understand the impact they had on you and fosters deeper connection.\n3. Express your needs that were fulfilled by the person's actions. This allows for mutual understanding and strengthens the relationship.	770	22	3	**Non-Violent Communication and Celebration**\n\n1. Importance of Celebration: Non-violent communication is not only about conflict resolution but also celebrating life by expressing gratitude.\n2. Fuel for Giraffe Transformation: Celebration provides the energy needed to stay true to one's nature in a \jackalish\" world.\n3. Jackals and Compliments:\n   - Moralistic judgments can be as violent as negative ones.\n   - Praise or compliments used as rewards are dehumanizing and destroy the beauty of gratitude.\n4. Building Self-Esteem:\n   - If someone's self-esteem depends on external validation, it is unhealthy.\n   - Giraffe expression of gratitude focuses on specific actions that make life more wonderful for others.\n5. Giraffe Expression of Gratitude:\n   - Concretely identify what the person did to make life more wonderful.\n   - Share how you feel about their action in that moment.\n   - Acknowledge the need fulfilled by their action.\n6. Example of Giraffe Gratitude:\n   - Woman expresses gratitude for specific actions that made her feel hopeful and relieved, fulfilling her need to connect with her son.\n<|im_end|>"	1139	31	3	Summary: The text discusses the importance of non-violent communication and celebrating life through expressions of gratitude. It highlights the differences between a \jackal\" approach to praise and compliments, which can be manipulative and dehumanizing, and a \"giraffe\" approach that focuses on specific actions that make life more wonderful for others. The giraffe method involves three key aspects: identifying what the person did, expressing how it made you feel at that moment, and understanding the need fulfilled by their actions. By following this approach to gratitude, individuals can foster a positive environment and maintain their focus on making life more wonderful for themselves and others.\n<|im_end|>"	723	21	1

However, the jackal also has the concept of \deserve\" in its head, which can be dangerous and lead to a violent way of life.\n3. **The Concept of Deserve:** The idea that one must deserve appreciation or punishment is a key ingredient in a destructive economic system and correctional system.

Golda Meir's quote about not being so humble highlights this idea.\n5. **The Fear of Gratitude:** The main reason why gratitude is scary for many people to receive is because it reminds them of their own light and power, which they have been taught to fear or hate.

i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal	5107	I.

It emphasizes the need to start by understanding the other person's intentions and feelings before expressing one's own needs. The author also highlights the significance of avoiding blame or rejection when communicating, as it can lead to misunderstandings and negative reactions. By using empathy and clear communication, individuals can better understand each other's perspectives and work towards finding a solution that meets both parties' needs.	677	16	2	 ```The text provided by the user contains several key concepts that need to be addressed in order to construct a comprehensive summary. The first concept is the need for empathy and understanding, which is highlighted in the statement \I have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that I want her to be happy.\" The user also mentions the importance of actionable steps rather than just feelings, as well as the paradoxical bind created by being told to feel a certain way.\n\nThe second concept is the dynamic between the user and their partner, which involves tension and the need for both parties to be in a good mood before engaging in activities together. The user expresses frustration with being told that they need to be in a better mood before their partner wants to go out with them.\n\nThe third concept is the relationship with the user's mother, where there is a dynamic of wanting to help but also respecting the user's independence.

They also mention a desire for independence in planning their own activities.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe user's summary notes highlight several key concepts: the need for empathy and understanding, the dynamic with their partner where both parties need to be in a good mood before engaging in activities together, and the relationship with their mother involving a balance between support and independence.

This involves letting go of the belief that we caused the other person's pain and not trying to fix their problems.\n   - **Releasing Responsibility**: To release ourselves from the first kind of responsibility, we must recognize that we did not cause the other person's pain, especially if they are blaming us for it. For the second kind of responsibility, we must understand that we cannot fix another person's psychological pain and trying to do so will only make things worse.\n   - **Empathy**: Empathy is key to enjoying someone else's suffering. It requires presence, which means being fully present with the other person without trying to fix their problems or give advice.

The speaker mentions earlier in the conversation that enjoying suffering is an important concept.\nB. A friend of the speaker says to them, \I'm a nothing, I'll never amount to anything,\" and compares themselves unfavorably to their siblings who have achieved success.\nC. The speaker wants to elaborate on how to enjoy this person's suffering.\n\nII. Releasing Responsibility\nA. To enjoy someone's suffering, we must release ourselves from two kinds of responsibility:\n1. We did not cause the pain that we want to release ourselves from, especially if the other person is trying to make us believe we did.\n2. We have a responsibility to fix it and make the person feel better, but this can actually make things worse.\nB. The second kind of responsibility is harder to let go of because we may feel like it's our job to help the person feel better.\nC. However, we don't have to fix people; there is a powerful healing energy available if we don't block it by trying to fix things ourselves.\n\nIII. Empathy and Enjoyment\nA. To help the healing energy do its job, we must practice empathy.\nB. Empathy requires presence, which means simply being present when we are with the person who is suffering.\nC. By being present, we can form a precious connection with the person that brings joy and healing, even if they are feeling pain.\nD. When we step in and try to fix things, we block this beautiful energy and make things worse.\n\nIV. Example\nA. The speaker gives an example of someone who is feeling discouraged and frustrated because they have not achieved as much in their life as they would like.\nB. Instead of trying to fix the situation or give advice, the speaker simply listens and is present with the person, forming a precious connection that does the healing.\nC. This is an example of how enjoying someone's suffering can bring joy and healing to both parties.\n\nV. Conclusion\nA. The speaker emphasizes that enjoying someone's suffering requires releasing ourselves from responsibility and practicing empathy.\nB. By being present and forming a precious connection with the person, we can bring joy and healing even in difficult situations."	2195	33	2
can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is suffering and sometimes by being there it's sort of a subtle encouragement as opposed to the subtle encouragement that i think you're talking about comes about when this person is talking about what happened to them for the fiftieth time you heard the story so, if i'm really listening to them i don't hear what they talk about the past cause i know that the more they talk about the past the less healing will take place so i interrupt but i interrupt to bring the conversation to life they're talking about the past and i interrupt then and i say excuse me but sounds like right now you're still feeling hurt because your need for respect wasn't met in that see, cause just letting them talk about the past and asking them questions about what happened about the past is to just keep the soap opera going so i interrupt when they talk about the past cause we don't heal by talking about the past we heal by talking about what's alive in us right now stimulated by the past but it's what's here now and when i connect at that level they won't keep talking about it they'll heal last question and then i'm going to get into the subject that i'd like to cover before the end	1324	**Distinction between Empathizing and Encouraging/Supporting a Suffering Individual**\n\n- Empathizing: Understanding and sharing the feelings of another person.\n- Key Concept: Feeling with the individual, not just for them.\n- Example: Listening to their story without judgment or criticism.\n\n- Encouraging/Supporting: Providing positive reinforcement and motivation for someone going through a difficult situation.\n- Key Concept: Offering help and guidance while respecting their autonomy.\n- Example: Asking open-ended questions to help them process their emotions and experiences.\n\n**The Impact of Repeatedly Talking About the Past**\n\n- The individual may feel unheard or unvalidated if they are constantly talking about past events.\n- Key Concept: Focusing on the present is crucial for healing and growth.\n- Example: Interrupting to redirect the conversation towards their current emotions and experiences.\n\n- Repeatedly discussing the past can hinder the healing process.\n- Key Concept: Healing occurs when individuals focus on what's alive within them in the present moment.\n- Example: Encouraging the person to explore their feelings and thoughts without dwelling on past events.\n\n**The Importance of Active Listening**\n\n- Actively listening involves understanding the individual's emotions, experiences, and needs.\n- Key Concept: Demonstrating empathy and genuine concern for the person's well-being.\n- Example: Interrupting to ask clarifying questions or provide support when appropriate.\n\n- Active listening helps individuals feel heard and understood, which can lead to healing and growth.\n- Key Concept: Building trust and rapport with the individual is essential in providing effective support.\n- Example: Validating their feelings and experiences while offering guidance on how to move forward.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, empathizing with a suffering individual involves understanding and sharing their emotions without judgment or criticism. Encouraging/supporting them requires providing positive reinforcement and motivation while respecting their autonomy. It is crucial to focus on the present moment rather than dwelling on past events for healing to occur. Active listening plays a vital role in building trust, rapport, and offering effective support to those going through difficult situations.	2349	22	2	 Distinction between Empathizing, Encouraging, and Supporting in a Soap Opera Context:\n\n1. Empathy vs Encouragement/Support:\n   - Empathy involves understanding and sharing another person's feelings without judgment or advice-giving.\n   - Encouragement and support are actions that help someone feel better or take positive steps towards healing.\n\n2. Subtle Encouragement in a Soap Opera Context:\n   - When someone is suffering, being there for them can be seen as subtle encouragement to continue sharing their story.\n   - This can lead to the person talking about their past experiences repeatedly without making progress in healing.\n\n3. Healing through Conversation:\n   - To promote healing, it's important to focus on what's happening in the present and how it relates to the past.\n   - Interrupting a conversation about the past can help shift the focus to the present and encourage healing.\n\n4. Interrupting the Soap Opera:\n   - When someone is talking about their past experiences, interrupting them can be seen as rude or dismissive.\n   - However, if done with empathy and understanding, it can help the person move forward in their healing process.\n\n5. Healing through Present-Focused Conversations:\n   - By focusing on what's happening in the present and how it relates to the past, we can encourage healing and growth.\n   - This approach involves connecting with the person at a deeper level and helping them see their own strengths and resources.	1478	18	3	 To clarify the distinction between empathizing and encouraging a soap opera, we must first understand what each term entails. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It involves listening without judgment or advice-giving, which can be therapeutic for the person sharing their story. Encouraging a soap opera, on the other hand, is when one's presence or actions inadvertently prolong or intensify someone else's suffering by allowing them to dwell on negative experiences or emotions.\n\nNow, let's break down the text into key concepts and sub-topics:\n\n1. **Distinction between empathizing and encouraging a soap opera:**\n   - Empathy involves active listening without judgment or advice-giving.\n   - Encouraging a soap opera can happen when one's presence prolongs someone else's suffering by allowing them to dwell on negative experiences.\n\n2. **Subtle encouragement through listening:**\n   - When someone is suffering, being present and actively listening can be seen as subtle encouragement.\n   - However, if this leads to the person talking about their past for an extended period without healing, it becomes a form of encouraging a soap opera.\n\n3. **Subtle encouragement through questions:**\n   - Asking questions about what happened in the past can keep the conversation focused on the past, which may not lead to healing.\n   - This is different from interrupting to bring the conversation to life by focusing on current emotions and needs.\n\n4. **Interrupting to bring the conversation to life:**\n   - Interrupting a person talking about their past can be seen as a way to break the cycle of dwelling on negative experiences.\n   - By connecting with the person's current emotions, one can help them move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past.\n\n5. **Healing through present-focused conversations:**\n   - Healing does not come from talking about the past; it comes from addressing current needs and emotions.\n   - By focusing on what is alive in the person right now, one can help them move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past.\n\n6. **Last question before covering a new subject:**\n   - The speaker wants to address another topic before the end of their discussion.\n\nTo construct a Chain of Thought reasoning, we would start by acknowledging that empathy and encouraging a soap opera are two different things. Empathy involves active listening without judgment or advice-giving, which can be therapeutic for someone sharing their story. Encouraging a soap opera, on the other hand, is when one's presence prolongs someone else's suffering by allowing them to dwell on negative experiences.\n\nNext, we would explain that subtle encouragement through listening and questions can happen unintentionally. While being present and actively listening can be seen as supportive, if it leads to dwelling on the past without addressing current needs, it becomes a form of encouraging a soap opera. Asking questions about what happened in the past may keep the conversation focused on the past rather than on healing.\n\nThen, we would introduce the concept of interrupting to bring the conversation to life as a way to break this cycle. By interrupting and focusing on current emotions and needs, one can help the person move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past. This is different from simply listening or asking questions about the past.\n\nFinally, we would emphasize that healing does not come from talking about the past; it comes from addressing current needs and emotions. By focusing on what is alive in the person right now, one can help them move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past. This is the key to avoiding encouraging a soap opera and instead supporting someone's journey towards healing.\n\nIn conclusion, while empathy and listening are important, it's crucial to be aware of how our presence and actions can unintentionally prolong someone else's suffering. By interrupting to bring the conversation to life and focusing on current emotions and needs, we can help someone move towards healing rather than staying stuck in the past.	4181	50	0	1. **Empathizing vs Encouraging Soap Opera:**\n   - Empathizing is understanding and sharing another person's feelings, while encouraging soap opera involves passively listening to someone's suffering without actively helping them move forward.\n   - Encouraging soap opera can be subtle when it comes from a place of genuine concern but may also lead to the victim becoming stuck in their story.\n2. **Subtle Encouragement:**\n   - Subtle encouragement is about guiding someone towards healing by focusing on what's happening now rather than dwelling on past events.\n   - This involves interrupting when someone talks about the past and redirecting the conversation to the present, where healing can occur.\n3. **Healing Through Conversation:**\n   - Healing doesn't come from talking about the past; it comes from addressing the emotions that are alive in the present moment.\n   - By interrupting when someone talks about the past and focusing on what's happening now, a therapist can help their client move towards healing.\n4. **Interrupting Past-Focused Conversations:**\n   - Interrupting conversations about the past is not to dismiss the past but to bring attention to the present emotions that are being triggered by it.\n   - This helps the client understand how the past affects them in the present and can lead to healing.\n5. **Healing Through Present-Focused Conversations:**\n   - By focusing on what's happening now, a therapist can help their client process their emotions and move towards healing.\n   - This involves connecting with the client at an emotional level and helping them understand how their past experiences are affecting their present life.\n6. **Last Question and Subject Coverage:**\n   - The last question is likely about the subject that will be covered before the end of the conversation, which may relate to the distinction between empathizing and encouraging soap opera or the importance of focusing on the present for healing.	1969	22	1	\nI.

It involves actively listening and trying to understand their perspective.\n* Encouraging, on the other hand, is the act of motivating or supporting someone to take action or achieve a goal. It can involve providing advice, guidance, or encouragement.\n* In the context of someone who is suffering, empathizing can be subtle and may involve simply being there for them without actively trying to fix their problems. However, if the person has been talking about their past for a long time and it's not leading to healing, it may be necessary to interrupt and bring the conversation to the present moment.\n\n**Healing through Talking About the Present**\n\n* Healing from trauma or difficult experiences often involves processing what has happened in the past. However, simply talking about the past can also perpetuate the cycle of suffering if it doesn't lead to healing.\n* To promote healing, it's important to focus on what is happening in the present moment and how it is being stimulated by the past. This involves connecting with the person on a deeper level and helping them see how their experiences have shaped them and how they can use that understanding to move forward.\n\n**Interrupting to Bring Conversation to Life**\n\n* If someone has been talking about their past for a long time and it's not leading to healing, it may be necessary to interrupt and bring the conversation to the present moment. This can involve acknowledging the person's feelings and helping them see how they are still feeling hurt or upset because of an unmet need for respect.\n* By interrupting and bringing the conversation to the present moment, it becomes possible to connect with the person on a deeper level and help them heal from their experiences. This can involve asking questions about what is happening in the present moment and how it is being stimulated by the past.\n\n**Last Question and Next Topic**\n\n* After discussing the importance of empathizing vs encouraging and healing through talking about the present, the speaker moves on to their next topic before the end of the conversation.	2220	24	2
you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in a lot of families and the suffering that i've experienced throughout my life through my recovery and all that yes and other people were a stimulus for your suffering and you were participant in how you dealt with it for example: if you follow me in my work you would see this very clearly in places like rwanda, burundi, sierra leone i'm working with people that have had their families killed some of those people have such rage that all they live for, moment by moment, is the possibility of vengeance others have no anger have never had anger same exact stimulus they have deep feelings but not rage so it is not the stimulus that determines how our emotional reaction is that part is up to us i work with some women unfortunately a lot who've been raped and some of them feel shame deep shame some feel rage some feel other things so the same stimulus depends on how people take it whether they feel shame, rage, or other things i'm working with a woman from rwanda she heard her three children being killed cause she got... to underneath the sink hid underneath the sink in time her children didn't make it to the hiding place in time they got killed she heard them she heard her husband being killed and her brother she had to stay underneath there eleven days to save her own life cause they stayed in their house after they killed the family this woman has deep feelings but never once has she had that kind of anger that makes her wanna get vengeance she's put all of her feelings and lots of them into protecting preventing this happening to anybody else so the way she looked at it leads her to want to prevent this happening to anybody else she came to my workshop because she wanted to know how to deal with the rage toward her from other people in her tribe who are furious with her that she won't join their efforts to kill the other people same stimulus quite different reactions okay, so i had this stimulus and somewhere i learned how to deal with it in a way that i had to deal with it and i'm learning to change that now the worst thing of course would be to now matter how you did choose to deal with it is to think there's something wrong with how you chose to deal with it that not wanting us to get into one way is right or wrong I'm just saying that no matter what happens to us the other person's responsible for what they did i'm not saying the other person doesn't have responsibility that's my question about accountability that person's responsible for what they did and why they did it we're responsible for how we deal with that okay? i'm just wondering how a child becomes responsible i mean still you know the first thing i do i wouldn't wanna teach the child the lesson i just taught you until i had given that child all the empathy that child needed and i guess it would be a lot so i can see myself dealing with a long time of hearing this child's enormous pain as a result of this but then, in the course of this i would be seeing this child having some pain created by how they looked at it so i would see that they're creating pain on top of the pain by how they looked at it so, after the child had all the empathy he or she needed then i would do what i could to get them to see it in a way that wouldn't create unnecessary pain for themself this is a debut jackal, yes	3461	**Summary of Text:**\n\n- Emotional pain can be caused by others' actions and experiences.\n* Example: Abuse, suffering, and trauma from personal or family history.\n* Not everyone reacts the same way to the same stimulus.\n* How we react depends on our perspective and coping mechanisms.\n* Some people may feel anger, while others may experience deep feelings but not rage.\n- The text discusses working with individuals who have experienced trauma and abuse.\n* Example: Rwandan women dealing with loss of family members and personal experiences.\n* Each person's reaction to the same stimulus is unique.\n* Some people choose to focus on preventing similar situations from happening to others, while others may feel anger or other emotions.\n- The text emphasizes that we are responsible for how we deal with our emotional pain.\n* Example: A woman from Rwanda who chose not to seek vengeance but instead focused on protecting others.\n* We must take accountability for our actions and reactions.\n* However, the text questions whether it is right or wrong to choose a specific way of dealing with emotional pain.\n- The text also discusses how empathy plays a role in helping individuals process their trauma.\n* Example: Teaching a child empathy before addressing their pain.\n* Empathy can help prevent unnecessary pain and suffering for both the individual and others around them.\n* The text concludes by acknowledging that everyone's journey is unique, and we must learn to navigate our emotions in a way that minimizes harm to ourselves and others.	1559	22	1	 Title: The Role of Emotional Responses and Accountability in Overcoming Suffering\n\nSummary:\n1. The speaker discusses the importance of understanding that emotional reactions to stimuli are not solely determined by external factors but also depend on how individuals choose to deal with them.\n2. They provide examples from their work in countries like Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone where people have experienced extreme suffering yet have different emotional responses due to their individual perspectives.\n3. The speaker emphasizes that accountability lies with the person responsible for causing harm, not with the victim's response to it.\n4. They raise the question of how a child can become responsible for their own emotional reactions and suggest that empathy should be provided before teaching them how to deal with their pain in a way that minimizes unnecessary suffering.	890	14	2	 To elaborate on the topic of emotional pain and its causes, we can use a Tree of Thoughts to break down the key concepts. The first branch of thought is about the stimulus for emotional pain. The text states that \if someone else can not cause our emotional pain,\" which implies that it is within our control how we react to external events. This leads us to consider the second branch, which is the individual's role in dealing with emotional pain. The text provides examples from personal experiences and work in conflict zones, where individuals have different reactions to similar stimuli.\n\nThe third branch of thought is about the responsibility for emotional pain. The text introduces the concept that while others are responsible for their actions, we are responsible for how we deal with those actions. This raises the question of accountability and the role of empathy in understanding one's own reactions to emotional pain.\n\nTo backtrack and construct a clear Chain of Thought reasoning, let's consider the first branch about the stimulus for emotional pain. The text provides examples from personal experiences and work in conflict zones, where individuals have different reactions to similar stimuli. This suggests that while external events may trigger emotional pain, it is not necessarily the sole determinant of how one reacts.\n\nThe second branch focuses on individual responsibility. The text emphasizes that we are responsible for our own reactions to emotional pain. This implies that we can choose how to interpret and respond to external stimuli, which leads us to consider the third branch about accountability and empathy.\n\nThe third branch is about accountability and empathy. It introduces the concept of responsibility for one's actions and the need for empathy in understanding one's own reactions to emotional pain. This raises the question of how we can teach children to deal with emotional pain without creating additional suffering.\n\nTo address this, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where a child is dealing with emotional pain caused by external events. The text suggests that before teaching the child about responsibility and empathy, one would first provide empathetic support to help the child process their pain. This implies that empathy is a prerequisite for understanding one's own reactions and taking responsibility for them.\n\nIn summary, the Tree of Thoughts reveals that emotional pain has multiple causes, including external stimuli and individual interpretations. It also highlights the importance of personal accountability and empathy in dealing with emotional pain. Backtracking through these thoughts allows us to construct a clear Chain of Thought reasoning that emphasizes the role of choice and responsibility in managing emotional pain."	2814	39	0	 ### Summary of Text\n\nThe text discusses the concept of emotional pain and how individuals can respond differently to similar stimuli.

okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get the idea that non-violent communication is solely interested in conflict resolution because it's equally interested in celebration how can we celebrate life in fact the part that i've left for ten minutes before the end is in some respects the most important part because it's where we get the fuel to stay giraffe in what's often a very jackalish world so it's gonna be pretty hard to make this radical transformation to back to our nature in many situations unless we're getting plenty of fuel now where does this fuel come from the fuel comes from celebration and what kind of celebration? comes from saying thank you in giraffe so let's see now in the last minutes how we celebrate by saying thank you in giraffe expressing gratitude in giraffe and first i'd like to remind you of how jackals say thank you: you did a good job on that paper you are a very kind person you're a good dancer can why that's jackal? moralistic judgments positive moralistic judgments are equally as violent in my estimation as negative ones mainly they reinforce the idea that the negative exist if i say you're a kind person i'm implying there's such a thing as an unkind person i'm also implying that i'm the judge that knows the difference so no more praise or compliments, okay? no more praise or compliments especially if you intend them as a reward that's the ultimate dehumanization to use thank you as a reward to say it for the purpose of trying to reinforce something to get the person to continue doing it it's like sending a... you know, what what gets on at dog obedience school? punishment and rewards giving a compliment or praise for the purpose of reinforcement is giving the dog a something to eat, to reinforce it for something people are not for that treatment and it destroys the beauty of thank you when people have to wonder - is this being said out of that energy? but it works! what does, jackal? studies in management indicate that if managers praise and compliment employees they lead production goes up studies in school show that if teachers praise and compliment students daily they work harder jackal, take another look at the research i think you'll see that that only works for a very short time until people see the manipulation and then it no longer works and it destroys the beauty of thank you because now you can not even trust gratitude without wondering whether it's being used as a reinforcement as a reward well, what about if i wanna build up the other person's self-esteem? what's wrong with that? so, you, jackal, you don't see the irony of that? what? if the other person can only like themself if you compliment them they have no self-esteem you just addicted them to your rewards that they only feel good when you say something about them they have no self-esteem okay how does a giraffe say thank you? or gratitude? first, there's three things that are involved in giraffe expression of gratitude that give us energy to keep being a giraffe the first thing in the giraffe expression of gratitude is we bring to this other person's attention concretely, what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us see, that's what we need to do, daily we need to bring our consciousness and attention to the power that each one of us has to make life more wonderful each of us is a power house we have words that have the power to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful we have touch, we can touch people in ways that can make life more wonderful we can provide services for other people we are powerhouses the more we remember this we'll not get caught up in any violent games why would we use our energy any way other than to make life wonderful when we remember that we have this power so that's one thing we gotta make clear in our expression of gratitude specifically what the person did not some vague generality for example, a woman in Geneva, Switzerland, came up to me at the end of a workshop here's what she said to me: you're brilliant i said, doesn't help she said: what do you mean? i said, you know ma'am, i have been called a lot of names in my life really, i have, some positive, and some far less than positive and i can never recall learning anything valuable by somebody telling me what i am i think there's zero information value in being told what you are and great danger - you might believe it and it's just as dangerous to believe that you're smart as that you're stupid both of them reduce you to a thing we're much more than either of those but i can see in your eyes that you want to express some gratitude yes - and i wanna receive it, but doesn't help me to be told what i am what do you need to hear? what did i do to make life more wonderful for you? well, you're so intelligent no, doesn't help doesn't help. what did i do? oh, i got you. she opens up her notebook she shows me two things that i had said she had written down she put a big star by them see, that helps me now, okay that helps me to know that somehow my saying those two things made this person's life more wonderful so that's the first thing we need to say in appreciation we need to bring to the person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful second, at the moment we're giving the gratitude to say how we feel at that moment about the person having done that so i said to this woman: could you tell me how you feel now as a result of my having said those two things? she said: hopeful and relieved oh, hopeful and relieved that gives me much more than telling me what i am that i'm brilliant just to know that somehow my saying those two things now this person feels hopeful and relieved now when i hear the third thing i'll be able to really enjoy this gratitude i said: what need of yours was fulfilled by my saying what i did that leaves you feeling hopeful and relieved? and that's the third thing we need to see in a giraffe gratitude she said: i have an 18-year old son i'd never been able to connect with him it's been very painful that we never can connect and i have needed some direction to help me connect with him those two things you said met my need for some concrete direction so, had she expressed her gratitude in giraffe she would have said, marshall, when you said these two things, showed me what the two things were it leaves me feeling hopeful and relieved it meets a need of mine to connect with my son in a way that i want okay, that's how we say gratitude in giraffe those three things	6632	1. Importance of Celebrating Life:\n- Celebration is crucial for fueling our ability to stay true to our nature in a challenging world.\n- Fuel comes from expressions of gratitude and celebration.\n\n2. Gratitude as the Source of Fuel:\n- Gratitude fuels us by acknowledging others' actions that make life more wonderful.\n- It helps us recognize our power to contribute positively to others' lives.\n\n3. Expression of Gratitude in Giraffe:\n- Three key elements are involved in expressing gratitude:\na) Bringing attention to the specific action done by the person, making it concrete and meaningful.\nb) Sharing how we feel at that moment about the person's actions.\nc) Identifying the need of the other person that was fulfilled through our expression of gratitude.\n\n4. The Danger of Using Gratitude as a Reward:\n- Praise or compliments given for reinforcement purposes can be manipulative and destroy the beauty of gratitude.\n- Trust in gratitude is lost when it's used as a reward, making people question its sincerity.\n\n5. Building Self-Esteem through Compliments:\n- Complimenting someone to build their self-esteem can backfire by creating an addiction to external validation and hindering self-esteem development.\n- Giraffe gratitude focuses on the specific actions that made life more wonderful, rather than general praise or compliments.\n\n6. Giraffe Gratitude:\n- Three elements are crucial for expressing gratitude in giraffe:\na) Bringing attention to the concrete action done by the person.\nb) Sharing how we feel at that moment about the person's actions.\nc) Identifying the need of the other person that was fulfilled through our expression of gratitude.	1683	41	2	 Summary:\n\n1. Non-violent communication is not solely interested in conflict resolution but also celebrating life.\n2. Celebration comes from expressing gratitude and saying thank you.\n3. Jackalish praise or compliments are equally violent as negative judgments because they imply the existence of unkind people and reinforce the idea that the negative exists.\n4. Giraffe expression of gratitude involves three key components: specifying what the person did, stating how it made life more wonderful, and identifying the need fulfilled by their actions.	556	20	2	1. The first thing we need to do is bring to this other person's attention concretely what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us. This involves being specific about the actions taken by the other person and how they contributed to making our lives better.\n2. Next, at the moment of expressing gratitude, we should say how we feel at that moment about the person having done those things. This helps the recipient understand the impact their actions have had on us emotionally.\n3. Finally, we need to see in a giraffe gratitude the third thing: what need of ours was fulfilled by the other person's actions? This is crucial because it shows how our gratitude is not just about praising someone but also about recognizing and appreciating their contribution to meeting our needs.\n4. By being specific, honest, and acknowledging the impact on our emotions and needs, we can express genuine gratitude in a way that is meaningful and energizing for both parties involved.	987	25	0	1. **Heading**: Celebration and Gratitude in Giraffe\n    - **Term**: Non-Violent Communication (NVC)\n    - **Key Concept**: The importance of celebration and gratitude in NVC.\n2. **Heading**: How Jackals Say Thank You\n    - **Term**: Positive Moralistic Judgments\n    - **Key Concept**: The use of praise or compliments as a form of judgment, which can be just as violent as negative judgments.\n3. **Heading**: No More Praise or Compliments\n    - **Term**: Reinforcement\n    - **Key Concept**: How praise and compliments can be used to reinforce behavior, which is seen as manipulative and destructive to the beauty of gratitude.\n4. **Heading**: Building Self-Esteem with Gratitude\n    - **Term**: Irony\n    - **Key Concept**: The irony in using gratitude to build self-esteem, which can lead to addiction to external validation.\n5. **Heading**: How Giraffes Express Gratitude\n    - **Term**: Concrete Acknowledgment\n    - **Key Concept**: The importance of being specific about what the other person did that made life more wonderful.\n    - **Term**: Emotional Response\n    - **Key Concept**: Sharing how one feels at the moment as a result of the other's actions.\n    - **Term**: Need Fulfillment\n    - **Key Concept**: Identifying the need that was fulfilled by the other person's actions, which completes the expression of gratitude.	1355	38	0	\nI.

Humble jackal vs. Golda Meir's perspective on humility:\n   - Different types of humility, with the jackal version being self-deprecating and negative.\n3.

The root of this tree is the concept of gratitude itself, which can be divided into two main branches: how we receive gratitude and how we express it.\n\nThe first branch, how we receive gratitude, is further subdivided into two sub-branches: the nature of gratitude and the impact of receiving it. The nature of gratitude encompasses the concept of \deserve,\" which is a dangerous idea that can lead to a violent way of life. It also includes the notion of humility, which can be either healthy or unhealthy depending on its source.\n\nThe second branch, how we express gratitude, is further subdivided into two sub-branches: the expression itself and the impact of expressing it. The expression of gratitude can take various forms, such as sincere appreciation or love, which can have a profound effect on both the giver and the receiver.\n\nBacktracking to the root concept of gratitude, we find that it is not only about receiving or giving but also about our relationship with ourselves. Gratitude can be seen as a way to celebrate life and acknowledge our own power to make it better. It is a form of self-love that can help us overcome the darkness within and embrace our light.\n\nIn summary, gratitude is a complex concept that involves both how we receive and express it. It is deeply connected to our relationship with ourselves and others, and it has the potential to transform our lives from one of violence and self-loathing to one of love and celebration."	1549	21	0	1. **It's also important how we receive gratitude:**\n   - **Jackal receives gratitude**: Jackals are known for their survival instincts. When a jackal is offered a ride by someone, it feels very grateful because it has a need to spend more time with its family. If the jackal took the bus, it would have an hour less time with its family, which is nothing compared to the value of spending time with loved ones.\n   - **Expressing love or appreciation**: Jackals are sensitive creatures. When they receive genuine expressions of love or appreciation, they can become nervous because they may not feel like they deserve it. This nervousness stems from a dangerous concept in their head called \deserve,\" which implies that one must earn appreciation and punishment for certain behaviors.\n   - **The concept of \"deserve\"**: The concept of \"deserve\" is a key ingredient in a violent way of life. It sets up an economic system where things are worth more than others, and it can lead to a destructive correctional system. This concept is dangerous because it creates a hierarchy based on perceived value rather than intrinsic worth.\n   - **Humility**: Jackals may also feel nervous when they receive gratitude because of their need for humility. There are different kinds of humility, and the jackal's kind can be self-defeating. It's important to distinguish between a healthy form of humility that recognizes one's limitations and a destructive form that leads to self-loathing.\n   - **Our light scares us**: The Course in Miracles suggests that our light, not our darkness, is what scares us the most. We have been educated to hate ourselves and think there's something wrong with us. It's a big jump for us to come to terms with our own power to make life wonderful because it challenges our negative self-perception.\n   - **Celebrating versus praising**: When we receive gratitude, it's important to celebrate rather than praise or reward. Celebration is about acknowledging and appreciating someone's efforts without attaching conditions or expectations. Praise can be conditional and may lead to a sense of entitlement or obligation.\n\n2. **Last comments or questions**:\n   - The speaker thanks the audience for their time and attention, indicating that they value the interaction.\n   - They reiterate the importance of receiving gratitude with an open heart, without feeling entitled or deserving.\n   - The speaker emphasizes the need to celebrate rather than praise, as celebration is about acknowledging someone's worth without conditions.\n   - They remind us that it's a journey to come to terms with our own power and light, but it's a journey worth taking."	2681	37	2	\nI.

i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate i said it was undoable ok, right that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy tell me the action to get there that i can do if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful tell me the action don't just tell me be happy don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do to feel that confidence the action will get me there but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind okay well one of the other things would be when we get together i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a good mood and i'll be in a one but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do: and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it if it gets worse but first let me show you the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in and want to show me all the things that could be done you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna contribute to it yeah that's step one see what i mean that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure they don't hate themselves for what they're doing the more they hate themself for what they're doing the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their needs are in doing it okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day with i tell honestly how i feel i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would be impossible for a person to react this way if they heard it they would have gotten a gift they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say? you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said see if you wanna make it if you want to have people understand you differently never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother cause i do value very much that you're offering to help but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say? so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you? thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my own time could you tell me what you heard? so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right? now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal	5107	\n\n1. Situation with intimate partner:\n   - Need for partner to be happy (undesirable)\n   - Partner keeps telling the speaker to be happy\n   - Speaker wants actionable steps to achieve happiness\n   - Speaker doesn't want to go somewhere if partner is not in a good mood\n   - Anxiety about planning a trip with mother\n\n2. Communication strategies:\n   - Start by empathizing with the other person's intent and needs\n   - Express honestly how you feel and your needs\n   - Avoid saying \you misunderstood me\" or \"that isn't what I said\"\n   - Thank the person for their perspective, even if it's different from yours\n   - Repeat your message until they understand it correctly"	688	18	1	Notes:\n1. The individual has an inappropriate need for their partner to be happy at all times. They want specific actions to achieve happiness instead of just being told to be happy or have confidence.\n2. When the individual is not in a good mood, they expect empathy from their partner rather than being pressured to improve their mood for the sake of spending time together.\n3. The individual is planning a trip to visit their mother and feels anxious about their mother's tendency to help plan every detail of their stay. They worry that expressing their desire for independence might make the situation worse.\n4. To address this issue, the individual should start by empathizing with their mother's intent behind her behavior. This will show understanding and create a more positive environment for communication.\n5. Next, they should honestly express how they feel, making it clear that they appreciate their mother's support but need to make their own choices this year.\n6. After expressing their feelings, the individual should ask their mother to repeat what she heard them say to ensure clear understanding and avoid misunderstandings.\n7. If there is a misinterpretation, the individual should thank their mother for sharing her perspective instead of correcting her directly. This will encourage further communication and empathy.\n8. By using empathetic language and clearly expressing their needs, the individual can help their mother understand their desire for independence during the trip while maintaining a positive relationship.	1553	43	3	Here's the summary of this text.

Mother: The speaker should communicate their need for space and autonomy in planning their trip, ensure their mother understands their intentions, and avoid feeling rejected or misunderstood.	1376	31	2

Introduction\nA. You mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering could you elaborate on that?\nB. A friend of yours says this to you: I'm a nothing I'll never amount to anything look at... I'm an assistant clerk at 8's 45 my brother's a head of his company my sister's a top attorney and I'm a nothing okay?\nC. To enjoy this person's suffering, we have to release ourselves from two kinds of responsibility:\n1. That we didn't cause the pain that we want to release ourselves from\n2. The hard one to think - that we have to fix it to make the person feel better\n\nII. Releasing Responsibility\nA. We don't want to in any way think we caused this person's pain because we can't cause another person's psychological pain.\nB. The person wasn't saying that, so it's easy to liberate ourselves from feeling responsible.\nC. However, the second responsibility is harder to think - that we have to fix it to make the person feel better.\nD. The more we try to fix things ourselves, the more we make it worse because we can't fix people.\n\nIII. Empathy and Healing Energy\nA. To help the healing energy do its job, we need empathy.\nB. Empathy requires presence - just being present when we are with the person.\nC. The precious connection between the person and us is what I mean by enjoyment.\nD. When we are present with the person, whether they're feeling joy or pain, that's what I mean by enjoyment.\nE. We block that beautiful energy whenever we step in and try to fix things ourselves.\nF. Instead of giving advice, we should be present and let the healing energy work through us.\n\nIV. Example\nA. You're feeling really discouraged and frustrated because you haven't achieved as much in your life as you wanted.\nB. You would really have liked to make different use of some things than you have.\nC. Instead of trying to fix it, you should be present and let the healing energy work through you.\nD. The precious connection that results from this is what I mean by enjoyment, and it does the healing, not your advice or whatever.	2061	33	2	1. Understanding Enjoying Suffering:\n* Release self from two kinds of responsibility:\n\t+ Caused the pain (not applicable in this case)\n\t+ Belief that it's our job to fix the person's pain (common mistake)\n2. Empathy as a Healing Tool:\n* Presence: Being present with the person without trying to fix their problems\n* Remember Buddhist advice: Don't do something, stand there\n* Precious Connection: The connection between the person in pain and the empathetic listener that allows healing to occur\n3. Blocking the Healing Energy:\n* Trying to fix problems (interferes with natural healing process)\n* Giving advice (can make situation worse)\n4. Encouraging Empathy:\n* Example: A person feeling discouraged and frustrated about their lack of achievements in life\n* Being present without trying to fix the problem allows for a precious connection that leads to healing	877	16	1
can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the soap opera of you know, somebody who is somebody who is suffering and sometimes by being there it's sort of a subtle encouragement as opposed to the subtle encouragement that i think you're talking about comes about when this person is talking about what happened to them for the fiftieth time you heard the story so, if i'm really listening to them i don't hear what they talk about the past cause i know that the more they talk about the past the less healing will take place so i interrupt but i interrupt to bring the conversation to life they're talking about the past and i interrupt then and i say excuse me but sounds like right now you're still feeling hurt because your need for respect wasn't met in that see, cause just letting them talk about the past and asking them questions about what happened about the past is to just keep the soap opera going so i interrupt when they talk about the past cause we don't heal by talking about the past we heal by talking about what's alive in us right now stimulated by the past but it's what's here now and when i connect at that level they won't keep talking about it they'll heal last question and then i'm going to get into the subject that i'd like to cover before the end	1324	\n\n1. Empathizing vs Encouraging/Supporting:\n   - Empathy is understanding someone else's feelings without necessarily agreeing with them or sharing their experiences.\n   - Encouraging and supporting involves actively helping someone through a difficult situation, providing guidance and reassurance.\n\n2. Subtle Encouragement:\n   - When someone is suffering, being there for them can be seen as a subtle encouragement to continue talking about their problems.\n   - This type of encouragement may not always be helpful in the long run, as it can perpetuate the cycle of discussing past issues rather than focusing on healing.\n\n3. Healing vs Talking About the Past:\n   - Healing involves moving forward and addressing current needs and emotions, rather than dwelling on past events.\n   - By interrupting conversations about the past and redirecting them to focus on present feelings and experiences, one can encourage a more productive healing process.\n\n4. Interrupting Conversations:\n   - Interrupting conversations about the past is not meant to dismiss or invalidate someone's experiences but rather to shift the focus towards healing.\n   - By acknowledging the pain caused by past events and redirecting the conversation to present emotions, one can help the person move towards a more positive state of mind.\n\n5. Healing Through Present Emotions:\n   - Healing occurs when individuals are able to process their current emotions and experiences in relation to past events.\n   - By focusing on what is alive in them right now, rather than dwelling on the past, people can begin to heal and move forward.	1622	18	3	**Empathizing vs. Encouraging a Soap Opera**\n\n*Distinction between empathizing and encouraging a soap opera*\n\t+ Empathy: Understanding and sharing the feelings of another person\n\t+ Soap Opera: A never-ending cycle of drama and suffering\n\n*Subtle encouragement in listening to someone's story*\n\t+ Hearing the same story multiple times\n\t+ Not interrupting, allowing the person to talk about their past experiences\n\t+ This can perpetuate the soap opera by keeping the focus on the past rather than healing\n\n*Interrupting for healing and growth*\n\t+ Intervene when someone is talking about the past\n\t+ Bring attention to current feelings and needs related to the past experience\n\t+ Focus on what's alive in the present, stimulated by the past\n\t+ Connect at a deeper level to facilitate healing\n\t+ Avoiding the soap opera by shifting focus from the past to the present	888	16	3	Empathizing is a way of showing concern for someone else���s feelings, while encouraging or supporting can be done in many ways. It includes providing emotional support by listening attentively without judging them; offering positive feedback and encouragement when appropriate; helping others find solutions that work best for their situation; being there to help with daily tasks such as cooking meals, cleaning the house, running errands etc.; giving advice only if asked or needed (e.g., ���I think you should do X because Y happened���).\nEncouraging someone can be done in many ways too and is different from empathizing: it includes providing emotional support by listening attentively without judging them; offering positive feedback and encouragement when appropriate, helping others find solutions that work best for their situation.	843	11	0	 **Empathizing vs Encouraging**\n\n* Empathizing is the act of understanding and sharing the feelings of another person. It involves actively listening and trying to understand their perspective.\n* Encouraging, on the other hand, is the act of motivating or supporting someone to take action or achieve a goal. It can involve providing advice, guidance, or resources.\n* Sort of encouraging and supporting someone who is suffering can be subtle, but it still involves being there for them and trying to help them in some way.\n\n**Healing through Talking**\n\n* Healing from past experiences often involves talking about those experiences and processing them.\n* However, simply talking about the past may not necessarily lead to healing. In fact, it can sometimes perpetuate the problem or keep someone stuck in their past.\n* Instead of focusing solely on talking about the past, it's important to also focus on what is happening in the present moment and how those experiences are affecting us now.\n\n**Interrupting to Bring Conversation to Life**\n\n* Interrupting can be a useful tool when someone is stuck in their past and not making progress towards healing.\n* By interrupting, you can bring the conversation back to the present moment and help the person focus on what they can do right now to move forward.\n* It's important to approach interruptions with empathy and understanding, as interrupting can be seen as dismissive or unsupportive if not done correctly.\n\n**Connecting at a Deeper Level**\n\n* Healing often involves connecting with others on a deeper level, beyond just surface-level conversations about the past.\n* By connecting at this level, you can help someone gain perspective and see how their experiences are shaping their present and future.\n* This type of connection can be facilitated through activities such as therapy, support groups, or simply spending time with someone in a non-judgmental way.\n\n**Subject to Cover Before Ending**\n\n* The speaker mentions that they would like to cover a specific subject before ending the conversation. It's important to respect their wishes and allow them to bring up any topics they feel are important.\n* This can help ensure that all necessary information is discussed and that both parties have a clear understanding of each other's perspectives.	2330	26	3	 Summary:\n\n* Empathizing vs Encouraging and Supporting: The distinction between empathizing and encouraging and supporting someone who is suffering is subtle. While being there for them can be a form of encouragement, it can also be seen as keeping the \soap opera\" going if the person continues to talk about the past without any progress towards healing.\n* Healing through Talking About the Present: Instead of focusing solely on talking about the past, it is more effective to talk about what is alive in us now and how it has been stimulated by the past. This allows for a deeper connection and can lead to healing.\n* Interrupting to Bring Conversation to Life: If someone continues to talk about the past without any progress towards healing, interrupting and bringing the conversation to life can be helpful. By connecting at a deeper level, the person may stop talking about the past and begin to heal.\n* Last Question: The speaker would like to cover a specific subject before ending the conversation."	1016	10	2	1. Empathizing vs Encouraging:\n* Empathizing: Understanding and sharing feelings of someone who is suffering (e.g., listening without judgment)\n* Encouraging: Subtly pushing someone to move past their suffering by focusing on present emotions and experiences\n1. Distinction between empathizing and encouraging:\n* Encouraging vs Rehashing Past Suffering:\n\t+ Encouraging: Asking questions about the past can keep the conversation focused on healing, not just rehashing the past\n\t+ Rehashing Past Suffering: Allowing someone to talk endlessly about their past without interruption may perpetuate their suffering\n1. Interrupting and Bringing Conversation to Life:\n* Interrupting: Breaking the cycle of past-focused conversation by addressing present emotions\n* Bringing Conversation to Life: Introducing new perspectives or experiences that can stimulate healing and growth\n1. Healing through Present Emotions:\n* Past Experiences: Not the sole determinant of healing; focusing on present emotions and experiences is crucial for healing\n* Present Emotions: Stimulated by past experiences but centered on what's happening now, allowing for growth and healing	1166	14	2
you talk about having if someone else can not cause our emotional pain that's right and i think about the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in a lot of families and the suffering that i've experienced throughout my life through my recovery and all that yes and other people were a stimulus for your suffering and you were participant in how you dealt with it for example: if you follow me in my work you would see this very clearly in places like rwanda, burundi, sierra leone i'm working with people that have had their families killed some of those people have such rage that all they live for, moment by moment, is the possibility of vengeance others have no anger have never had anger same exact stimulus they have deep feelings but not rage so it is not the stimulus that determines how our emotional reaction is that part is up to us i work with some women unfortunately a lot who've been raped and some of them feel shame deep shame some feel rage some feel other things so the same stimulus depends on how people take it whether they feel shame, rage, or other things i'm working with a woman from rwanda she heard her three children being killed cause she got... to underneath the sink hid underneath the sink in time her children didn't make it to the hiding place in time they got killed she heard them she heard her husband being killed and her brother she had to stay underneath there eleven days to save her own life cause they stayed in their house after they killed the family this woman has deep feelings but never once has she had that kind of anger that makes her wanna get vengeance she's put all of her feelings and lots of them into protecting preventing this happening to anybody else so the way she looked at it leads her to want to prevent this happening to anybody else she came to my workshop because she wanted to know how to deal with the rage toward her from other people in her tribe who are furious with her that she won't join their efforts to kill the other people same stimulus quite different reactions okay, so i had this stimulus and somewhere i learned how to deal with it in a way that i had to deal with it and i'm learning to change that now the worst thing of course would be to now matter how you did choose to deal with it is to think there's something wrong with how you chose to deal with it that not wanting us to get into one way is right or wrong I'm just saying that no matter what happens to us the other person's responsible for what they did i'm not saying the other person doesn't have responsibility that's my question about accountability that person's responsible for what they did and why they did it we're responsible for how we deal with that okay? i'm just wondering how a child becomes responsible i mean still you know the first thing i do i wouldn't wanna teach the child the lesson i just taught you until i had given that child all the empathy that child needed and i guess it would be a lot so i can see myself dealing with a long time of hearing this child's enormous pain as a result of this but then, in the course of this i would be seeing this child having some pain created by how they looked at it so i would see that they're creating pain on top of the pain by how they looked at it so, after the child had all the empathy he or she needed then i would do what i could to get them to see it in a way that wouldn't create unnecessary pain for themself this is a debut jackal, yes	3461	\n\nTitle: The Role of Emotional Reactions and Accountability in Dealing with Painful Experiences\n\n1. Introduction:\n   - Discussion on the impact of emotional reactions to painful experiences.\n   - Recognition that stimuli do not determine our emotional responses; it is up to us how we react.\n   - Examples from Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone illustrate different emotional reactions to similar stimuli.\n\n2. Emotional Reactions:\n   - Stimulus vs. Response: The same stimulus can lead to different emotional reactions depending on the individual's perspective.\n   - Examples from Rwanda, Burundi, and Sierra Leone demonstrate how people respond differently to similar situations.\n   - Some individuals may feel shame, rage, or other emotions in response to a painful experience.\n\n3. Accountability:\n   - The person responsible for the stimulus is accountable for their actions and intentions.\n   - However, it is important not to blame the victim for how they reacted to the situation.\n   - The focus should be on helping individuals deal with their emotional reactions in a way that minimizes further pain and suffering.\n\n4. Teaching Emotional Responses:\n   - It is crucial to provide empathy and support to children who have experienced painful events before teaching them how to respond emotionally.\n   - The goal should be to help the child see their situation in a way that minimizes unnecessary pain and suffering.\n   - This process may take time, but it is essential for the child's well-being.	1524	24	2	**Emotional Pain and Responsibility**\n- Emotional pain cannot be solely caused by others; individuals have control over their emotional reactions.\n  - Example: People who experienced the same traumatic event may react differently due to individual interpretations of the situation.\n  \n**Stimulus vs. Reaction**\n- The stimulus (traumatic event) does not determine an individual's emotional reaction; it is up to the person how they choose to deal with it.\n  - Example: Women who have been raped may feel shame, rage, or other emotions depending on their interpretation of the situation.\n  \n**Responsibility and Accountability**\n- The person responsible for causing the trauma is accountable for their actions; however, individuals are also responsible for how they deal with the aftermath.\n  - Example: A woman from Rwanda who heard her family being killed chose to focus on preventing similar events in the future instead of seeking vengeance.\n  \n**Children and Responsibility**\n- Children need empathy and support before learning how to process their emotions related to traumatic experiences.\n  - Example: A child who experienced a traumatic event would first receive empathy and understanding, then be guided towards interpreting the situation in a way that reduces unnecessary pain.	1300	29	3	Here are some notes summarizing the above text.

Emotional Pain:\n* Stimulus: The presence of emotional pain in one's life due to past experiences or current situations.\n* Response: How an individual chooses to deal with their emotional pain, which can be influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, upbringing, and experiences.\n1. Rwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone:\n* Work in these regions involves helping individuals who have experienced severe trauma, such as the loss of family members or personal violence.\n* Differing emotional reactions to similar stimuli: Some individuals may experience rage, while others may feel no anger or deep shame.\n1. Case Study: Rwandan Woman:\n* Experienced severe trauma: Hearing her children and husband being killed, hiding underneath the sink for eleven days to avoid being killed herself.\n* Emotional response: Deep feelings of loss and protection, but no rage towards those who committed the violence against her family.\n1. Accountability:\n* The responsibility of an individual lies in how they choose to deal with their emotional pain, not in causing it.\n* The responsibility of others lies in their actions that caused the pain.\n1. Children's Emotional Development:\n* Teaching children to cope with trauma without inflicting further pain on them is crucial.\n* Empathy plays a significant role in this process, allowing the child to understand and express their feelings.\n1. Debunking the Myth of Jackal:\n* The term \Jackal\" refers to individuals who seek revenge or cause harm to others due to past traumas.\n* This concept is debunked as it assumes that all individuals who experience trauma will react in the same way, which is not true."	1653	29	1
okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe cause i wouldn't want you to get the idea that non-violent communication is solely interested in conflict resolution because it's equally interested in celebration how can we celebrate life in fact the part that i've left for ten minutes before the end is in some respects the most important part because it's where we get the fuel to stay giraffe in what's often a very jackalish world so it's gonna be pretty hard to make this radical transformation to back to our nature in many situations unless we're getting plenty of fuel now where does this fuel come from the fuel comes from celebration and what kind of celebration? comes from saying thank you in giraffe so let's see now in the last minutes how we celebrate by saying thank you in giraffe expressing gratitude in giraffe and first i'd like to remind you of how jackals say thank you: you did a good job on that paper you are a very kind person you're a good dancer can why that's jackal? moralistic judgments positive moralistic judgments are equally as violent in my estimation as negative ones mainly they reinforce the idea that the negative exist if i say you're a kind person i'm implying there's such a thing as an unkind person i'm also implying that i'm the judge that knows the difference so no more praise or compliments, okay? no more praise or compliments especially if you intend them as a reward that's the ultimate dehumanization to use thank you as a reward to say it for the purpose of trying to reinforce something to get the person to continue doing it it's like sending a... you know, what what gets on at dog obedience school? punishment and rewards giving a compliment or praise for the purpose of reinforcement is giving the dog a something to eat, to reinforce it for something people are not for that treatment and it destroys the beauty of thank you when people have to wonder - is this being said out of that energy? but it works! what does, jackal? studies in management indicate that if managers praise and compliment employees they lead production goes up studies in school show that if teachers praise and compliment students daily they work harder jackal, take another look at the research i think you'll see that that only works for a very short time until people see the manipulation and then it no longer works and it destroys the beauty of thank you because now you can not even trust gratitude without wondering whether it's being used as a reinforcement as a reward well, what about if i wanna build up the other person's self-esteem? what's wrong with that? so, you, jackal, you don't see the irony of that? what? if the other person can only like themself if you compliment them they have no self-esteem you just addicted them to your rewards that they only feel good when you say something about them they have no self-esteem okay how does a giraffe say thank you? or gratitude? first, there's three things that are involved in giraffe expression of gratitude that give us energy to keep being a giraffe the first thing in the giraffe expression of gratitude is we bring to this other person's attention concretely, what they have done that has made life more wonderful for us see, that's what we need to do, daily we need to bring our consciousness and attention to the power that each one of us has to make life more wonderful each of us is a power house we have words that have the power to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful we have touch, we can touch people in ways that can make life more wonderful we can provide services for other people we are powerhouses the more we remember this we'll not get caught up in any violent games why would we use our energy any way other than to make life wonderful when we remember that we have this power so that's one thing we gotta make clear in our expression of gratitude specifically what the person did not some vague generality for example, a woman in Geneva, Switzerland, came up to me at the end of a workshop here's what she said to me: you're brilliant i said, doesn't help she said: what do you mean? i said, you know ma'am, i have been called a lot of names in my life really, i have, some positive, and some far less than positive and i can never recall learning anything valuable by somebody telling me what i am i think there's zero information value in being told what you are and great danger - you might believe it and it's just as dangerous to believe that you're smart as that you're stupid both of them reduce you to a thing we're much more than either of those but i can see in your eyes that you want to express some gratitude yes - and i wanna receive it, but doesn't help me to be told what i am what do you need to hear? what did i do to make life more wonderful for you? well, you're so intelligent no, doesn't help doesn't help. what did i do? oh, i got you. she opens up her notebook she shows me two things that i had said she had written down she put a big star by them see, that helps me now, okay that helps me to know that somehow my saying those two things made this person's life more wonderful so that's the first thing we need to say in appreciation we need to bring to the person's attention concretely what they did that made life more wonderful second, at the moment we're giving the gratitude to say how we feel at that moment about the person having done that so i said to this woman: could you tell me how you feel now as a result of my having said those two things? she said: hopeful and relieved oh, hopeful and relieved that gives me much more than telling me what i am that i'm brilliant just to know that somehow my saying those two things now this person feels hopeful and relieved now when i hear the third thing i'll be able to really enjoy this gratitude i said: what need of yours was fulfilled by my saying what i did that leaves you feeling hopeful and relieved? and that's the third thing we need to see in a giraffe gratitude she said: i have an 18-year old son i'd never been able to connect with him it's been very painful that we never can connect and i have needed some direction to help me connect with him those two things you said met my need for some concrete direction so, had she expressed her gratitude in giraffe she would have said, marshall, when you said these two things, showed me what the two things were it leaves me feeling hopeful and relieved it meets a need of mine to connect with my son in a way that i want okay, that's how we say gratitude in giraffe those three things	6632	\n\n1.

I've used nested bullet points with headings, terms, and key concepts in bold as requested: \n- it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude \n- when you offered to give him the ride just now over to where he's going afterwards, he feels very grateful because he really has a need to spend more time with his family and if he took the bus he'd have an hour less time\n- it's nothing if you wanna terrorize a jackal, express love or appreciation to her/him. Really, if you want to scare him I've never seen anything that scares them as much as sincere gratitude or love \n- why do you get so nervous when you hear it? well, i don't know but he has this dangerous concept in his head - \deserve\". a very violent concept which implies that you have to deserve appreciation. You must behave in certain ways and if you believe in the concept of 'deserve' then you'll set up a destructive economic system as well as correctional systems, both are extremely harmful \n- this is why it's not only because else do you get so scared when you hear gratitude? what's wrong with being humble. So, you want to have need for humility yes but jackals also have different kinds of 'humility' and the one that golda meir was referring to in her quote \"don't be too humble\" is a very dangerous kind \n- i think your type has this as well which they call 'jackal humilty'. It's not only about being modest but it implies you have to behave in certain ways. You must do things that are worth doing and if you don't, then there will be punishment\n- jackals also believe that some people deserve more than others \n- this is a very dangerous concept which leads to setting up an economic system as well as correctional systems where the most violent ones get rewarded for their behaviour. This way of life has been set in place and it's extremely destructive, so much so that we have to be scared when someone expresses gratitude or love towards us\n- but there is another reason why you also become very nervous: jackals are afraid because they don't want to lose the power to make their lives wonderful. They enjoy exercising this power more than anything else and it's unfortunately a pretty big jump for them to come to \n- so that's how we say... gratitude, observation, feeling & need same literacy! Make sure it comes from your heart to celebrate but never praise or compliment/reward"	2464	47	0	 Summary:\n\n* Gratitude is a powerful concept that can have both positive and negative effects on individuals.\n* Jackals, in particular, may be hesitant to receive gratitude due to their dangerous concept of \deserve.\"\n* This concept implies that appreciation must be earned, and failure to do so can result in punishment.\n* Gratitude can also be scary for many people because it challenges their negative self-image and forces them to confront their own power to make life wonderful.\n* The Course of Miracles suggests that gratitude is our light, not our darkness, and that we have been educated to hate ourselves and think there is something wrong with us.\n* To truly receive gratitude, it must come from the heart and be celebrated, rather than praised or rewarded.\n* It's important to remember that gratitude is a powerful tool for making life wonderful and should be approached with humility and openness."	919	13	2	 Summary:\n\n* Gratitude is a powerful concept that can have both positive and negative effects on individuals.\n* Jackals, in particular, may be scared of receiving gratitude due to their dangerous concept of \deserve.\"\n* This concept implies that appreciation is only given to those who deserve it, which can lead to a destructive economic and correctional system.\n* Humility is also a factor in why jackals may be scared of receiving gratitude.\n* The Course of Miracles suggests that our light (our true selves) scares us the most, as we have been educated to hate ourselves and think there is something wrong with us.\n* Gratitude observation, feeling, and need should come from the heart and not be used for praise, compliment, or reward.\n* The speaker is grateful for the time and attention given during the conversation."	833	12	3	1.
