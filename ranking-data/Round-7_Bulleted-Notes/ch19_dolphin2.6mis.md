### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

 Chapter 19: The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900

Introduction: The Statue of Liberty represents a land of opportunity, yet many immigrants faced harsh realities in urban America.

19.1 Urbanization and Its Challenges:
- Reasons for rapid urban growth include industrialization, new technologies like electric lights and machinery leading to 24/7 factory operations, and immigration from Europe seeking better opportunities.
- Challenges of urban life included low wages, long hours, poor living conditions, overcrowding, disease, language barriers, class issues, race, ethnicity, and corrupt politics.
- Urbanization led to the development of unique city characters based on core industries such as steel in Pittsburgh, meat packing in Chicago, garment and finance in New York, and automobiles in Detroit.

The Keys to Successful Urbanization:
- Four critical innovations shaping urbanization at the turn of the century were electric lighting, communication improvements, intracity transportation, and the rise of skyscrapers.
- Electric lighting increased production in factories and enabled cities to operate 24/7, attracting more people to urban areas for job opportunities.
- Communication improvements such as the telephone facilitated instant communication over larger distances, increasing business demand and fueling urban growth.
- Intracity transportation helped address issues related to housing and living conditions by allowing urban centers to expand beyond their initial boundaries.
- The rise of skyscrapers allowed for more efficient use of land and resources in densely populated urban areas, further contributing to the success of urbanization.

### Intracity Transportation

 **Intracity Transportation**

During the growth of cities, efficient travel within them became a major challenge. Most transportation infrastructure was used to connect cities with each other through rail or canal. Before 1880, the most common form of transportation within cities was the omnibus, a large horse-drawn carriage placed on iron or steel tracks for a smoother ride. However, these could not handle larger crowds and were replaced by Frank Sprague's electric trolley in 1887.

**Elevated Trains and Subways**

As cities like Chicago and New York grew in population, trolleys struggled to move efficiently through crowded streets. To avoid this issue, city planners elevated the trolley lines above streets, creating elevated trains or L-trains. This started as early as 1868 in New York City and quickly spread to Boston in 1887 and Chicago in 1892. In response to the ever-increasing need for space in cities like Boston and New York, subways were introduced. The first subway system began operating in Boston in 1897, followed by New York and other cities.

**Rise of Skyscrapers**

The growth of skyscrapers was another way to overcome the challenges posed by limited space in large cities. Cities like Chicago and New York needed more space for real estate, and the introduction of steel construction techniques enabled builders to create taller buildings. However, these structures required an efficient elevator system, which was introduced by James Otis's Otis Elevator Company in 1889. This innovation led to the skyscraper craze, allowing developers to market prestigious real estate in crowded eastern metropoles.

**Immediate Challenges of Urban Life**

Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent issues in urban centers during this time. Living conditions for most working-class city dwellers were poor, with crowded tenement houses and cramped apartments lacking proper ventilation and sanitation. This resulted in the spread of diseases like typhoid and cholera. To address these challenges, cities introduced sewage pumping systems, improved fire safety measures, and provided community services through churches and civic organizations.

**Settlement House Movement**

The settlement house movement played a significant role in providing relief to working-class urban dwellers during the late 1800s. Pioneering women like Jane Addams and Lillian Wald established settlement houses that offered services such as gymnasiums, libraries, evening classes on hygiene and healthcare, and childcare facilities. These settlement houses expanded quickly across the United States, providing employment opportunities for college graduates in the growing field of social work and leading to the creation of laws aimed at improving living conditions for urban residents.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

 **Heading: Factors Prompting African American and European Immigration**

- The end of the Civil War led to a large exodus of African Americans from the South seeking better opportunities elsewhere.
- Both "push" factors (racism, violence, lack of voting rights) and "pull" factors (job opportunities, voting rights) influenced African American migration.
- European immigrants were also motivated by "push" factors such as famines, persecution, and compulsory military service. They were attracted to the United States by promises of wage-earning jobs.

**Heading: Discrimination and Anti-Immigration Legislation**

- African Americans faced discrimination in job opportunities and housing, with most working in low-paying unskilled or semi-skilled positions.
- New immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were blamed for societal issues, such as unemployment and overcrowding, leading to resentment and hatred.
- The American Protective Association was formed to address the perceived threat of these undesirable immigrants and lobbied Congress to pass legislation restricting immigration.
- This led to the implementation of an English language literacy test for immigrants in 1917, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and eventually the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924.

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

 **19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Identify how each class of Americans—working class, middle class, and upper class—responded to the challenges associated with urban life
- Explain the process of machine politics and how it brought relief to working-class Americans

**Settlement Houses and Religious and Civic Organizations**
Working-class city dwellers found some support through free healthcare, education, and leisure opportunities provided by settlement houses, religious organizations, and civic groups. However, life in the city remained chaotic and challenging for them.

**Challenges Faced by Each Class**

**Working Class:**
- Took advantage of machine politics for immediate solutions to urban challenges
- Enjoyed popular culture and entertainment like amusement parks, vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, and professional baseball as escapes from daily struggles

**Middle Class:**
- Sought relief in higher education opportunities and suburbanization

**Upper Class:**
- Remained close to the city's business core but enjoyed refined entertainment options like classical music concerts, fine art collections, and social gatherings with peers

**Machine Politics**
The primary form of relief for working-class urban Americans was machine politics. This system allowed citizens to approach an alderman who spoke on their behalf at city hall. In exchange for promises of political support in future elections, aldermen would find quick solutions to problems like sanitation or sidewalk construction.

**Popular Culture and Entertainment**
Working-class residents also found relief through popular culture and entertainment options such as amusement parks (e.g., Coney Island), vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, and professional baseball games. These forms of entertainment provided temporary escapes from the hardships of daily life.

**The Upper Class in Urban Centers**
Wealthy Americans preferred refined entertainment options like classical music concerts and social gatherings with peers, often distancing themselves from the working-class entertainment choices. They also sought unique ways to differentiate themselves from the middle class through expensive vacations and travel opportunities.

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

 **Title:** A New Middle Class: Education and Suburbanization

**Introduction**
- The working class lived in tenement houses in cities due to their need to be close to work and lack of funds for better housing.
- The wealthy elite chose to remain in the city for access to big business transactions.
- The emerging middle class, including managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, and accountants, responded to urban challenges with their own solutions through education and suburbanization.

**Education and the Middle Class**
- Education was more accessible to the children of the professional class as they did not need to leave school and find work to support their families.
- Public school enrollment tripled from seven million in 1870 to twenty-one million in 1920 due to the growth of public schools and the presence of stay-at-home mothers for middle-class children.
- High schools grew rapidly, with over six thousand high schools by 1900 compared to one hundred in 1860.
- The Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 provided federal funds for land-grant colleges that were affordable to middle-class families, focusing on practical subjects such as business, agriculture, and trade.
- College curricula shifted toward preparing students for professional careers in business, medicine, and law, with the development of professional schools.

**Suburbanization and Middle-Class Women's Roles**
- Suburbs offered an escape from urban chaos, allowing middle-class families to work in the city while living in suburban homes through improved transportation options such as trolleys and electric railways.
- The popularity of magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping reflected the focus on creating a positive home environment for working husbands and school-age children, reinforcing business and educational principles practiced outside the home.
- Middle-class women took on traditional roles as housewives and homemakers while some began attending college, opening up opportunities to work in teaching, professorship, or settlement houses created by Jane Addams.
- The first women's colleges opened during this period, providing an all-female environment focused on education.

**The "City Beautiful" Movement**
- The City Beautiful movement aimed to improve the quality of life for city dwellers and cultivate middle-class-dominated urban spaces through principles such as creating larger park areas within cities, building wider boulevards, and adding suburbs.
- The Columbian Exposition in 1893 showcased these principles with the "White City," which set a standard for American urban city planning.

### 19.4 Change Reflected in Thought and Writing

 **Chapter 19 Section Summary: Change Reflected in Thought and Writing**

In the late nineteenth century, Americans lived through a time of rapid change. New technologies, urban growth, and big business transformed society. This period saw the emergence of notable authors who provided insights into these changes. One key idea was Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which led to social Darwinism - the belief that societies evolved like natural organisms, with some individuals succeeding due to innate traits and adaptability. Critics of this ideology argued that it ignored inequality and lacked equal opportunities for success.

Other thinkers took Darwin's ideas in different directions, focusing on realism and the need for evidence-based understanding. William James popularized pragmatism, emphasizing the importance of experimentation to find truth. John Dewey expanded this concept into instrumentalism, advocating education as a tool for societal reform. Artists like George Bellows and authors such as Stephen Crane adopted realism in their works, portraying urban life and social issues. Naturalism, which saw nature as the ultimate authority governing humanity, was championed by Jack London.

Despite these positive changes, there were critics of modern America, including Edward Bellamy, Henry George, and Thorstein Veblen. Bellamy's novel "Looking Backward" envisioned a socialist future for America. Henry George criticized inequality in an industrial economy through his work "Progress and Poverty." Veblen lamented the rise of conspicuous consumption as a result of capitalism, highlighting economic inefficiencies that required reform.
