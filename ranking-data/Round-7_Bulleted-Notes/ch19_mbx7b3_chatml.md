### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

Chapter 19: The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900
Introduction: Sadie Frowne's arrival symbolizes new opportunities amidst dangers in the USA.

19.1 Urbanization and Its Challenges
- Objectives: Explain growth of American cities; identify challenges and solutions.
- Rapid urbanization due to industrialization, technology, immigration, and job prospects.
- Cities like Philadelphia, Boston, New York grew exponentially from mid-1800s; factories moved inland, away from rivers.
- Challenges: Low wages, long, repetitive work, poor living conditions, transportation, communication issues, class disparities, and ethnic conflicts.
- Unique city characters based on core industries (e.g., Pittsburgh - steel, Chicago - meat packing).

Keys to Successful Urbanization
- Innovations that shaped urban centers: electric lighting, communication improvements, intracity transport, skyscrapers.

Electric Lighting
- Thomas Edison's incandescent bulb (1879); common in homes and factories from 1882 onwards, benefiting city life.
- Nikola Tesla's AC system expanded power distribution, allowing urban centers to cover wider areas.
- Factories extended operations, attracting more workers and expanding cities.

Communications Improvements
- Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone (1876); 1.5 million in use by 1900.
- Instant communication over greater distances increased business pace and urban sprawl.
- More orders led to increased production, necessitating more workers and further city growth.

### Intracity Transportation

Intracity Transportation: As cities expanded, efficient travel within them became essential (omnibuses in early stages, later replaced by electric trolleys and elevated trains). Subways followed for underground transportation.

Urban Challenges & Solutions: Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent. Tenement living resulted in poor sanitation, leading to epidemics. Reforms included sewage systems, fire safety measures, church/religious interventions (social gospel), settlement houses, and women's suffrage/antiwar activism.

Defining American: Jacob Riis exposed slum conditions in New York through book "How the Other Half Lives" and photographs, sparking legislative changes to improve tenement living.

Key Figures & Innovations: Frank Sprague (electric trolley), James Otis (first electric elevator), Jane Addams (Hull House settlement founder), Florence Kelley & Julia Lathrop (National Child Labor Committee, Children's Bureau).

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

2. African American Great Migration: Key Points
  - Occurred between Civil War & Great Depression
  - Nearly 2 million fled South for opportunities
  - Primarily headed to Northeast, Upper Midwest cities (NY, Chicago, Phila, etc.)
  - Push factors: Post-Civil War racism, KKK violence
  - Pull factors: Job opportunities, voting rights, escaping dangers
  - Factory owners assisted migration
  - Men moved first, then families
  - Racism and lack of education limited jobs to low-paying sectors (mining, construction)
  - African American women faced gender discrimination in employment

3. New European Immigration: Parallels with Africans Americans
  - Southern & eastern Europeans replacing N/W Europeans as urban dwellers
  - Lacked funds to move west, remained in cities
  - Push factors: Famines, persecution, military avoidance
  - Pull factors: Consistent wage-earning work
  - Arrived without education and finances of previous waves
  - Settled in port towns instead of moving west
  - By 1890, over 80% NY population were foreign or children of immigrants
  - Ellis Island processing peak between 1900-1910 (9 million arrivals)

4. Immigration Discrimination and Legislation
  - Dillingham Commission confirmed ethnic identification & discrimination against new immigrants
  - Visible differences in skin tone, language, religion, customs led to scapegoating for societal issues
  - Reverend Josiah Strong's book stoked anti-immigrant sentiment
  - American Protective Association lobbied Congress to pass restrictions
    - English literacy test (1917)
    - Chinese Exclusion Act
  - Set stage for later legislation: Emergency Quota Act (1921), Immigration Act (1924), National Origins Act.

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

19.3 Urban Life Relief: Key Points

Objectives: Understand American class responses to urban challenges, machine politics' impact, and various relief sources for each social stratum.

Working Class:
- Machine Politics: Alleviated problems via ward system with aldermen dealing at city hall level (exemplified by Tammany Hall).
- Popular Culture/Entertainment: Amusement parks (e.g., Coney Island), vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, and baseball provided escape from urban hardships.

Middle & Upper Class Differences:
- Middle Class: Higher Education, suburbanization benefits; contrasted with working class in these aspects.
- Upper Class: Sought refined pastimes (classical music, art, social gatherings) and luxurious comforts to distance from city chaos. Elite escapes included Newport, Florida vacations, European trips, and "Social Register" recognition.

Urban Working Class Struggles Summary: Relief sought in machine politics and popular culture amid city challenges; Machine Politics offered immediate solutions via ward systems, while entertainment offered escape from urban hardships.

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

**A NEW MIDDLE CLASS**: Emerged responding to urban challenges with solutions based on education and suburbanization; included managers, salesmen, engineers, professionals with better education & compensation than working class poor.

**URBAN CHALLENGES ADDRESSED:** Relief from cities came through improved transportation facilitating suburban life for middle class with adequate means to escape workday chaos.
  - Electric railway growth in 1880s
  - Henry Ford's lower-priced automobile ownership
  - Interstate highway system & low-interest home loans later in 20th century

**MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN:** Focused on creating a positive home environment for families while magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping gained popularity. Some women pursued higher education, with first women's colleges opening (Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, 1865-1880).

**EDUCATION AND MIDDLE CLASS**: Children of the professional class benefited from opportunities for education and advancement, unlike working-class kids with parents also needing to work. Public school enrollment tripled from 7M in 1870 to 21M in 1920; larger schools, high school growth, & land-grant colleges (affordable by middle class).

**COLLEGE CURRICULA CHANGES**: Students moved away from liberal arts to prepare for the modern work world with professional schools for medicine, law, and business. Education tailored for middle-class advancement.

**"CITY BEAUTIFUL" MOVEMENT:** Aimed at improving urban quality of life through progressive reforms while creating spaces dominated by the middle and upper class. Leaders included Frederick Law Olmsted & Daniel Burnham, who showcased City Beautiful ideals at Columbian Exposition in 1893.
  - Larger parks, wider boulevards, and more suburbs were suggested for better urban planning.
