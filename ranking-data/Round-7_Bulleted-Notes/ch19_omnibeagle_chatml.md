### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

Chapter 19: The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900
Intro: Sadie Frowne's experience encapsulating the new world & challenges

19.1 Urbanization and Its Challenges
- Goals: Understand rapid urban growth & key challenges/possible solutions
- Reasons for urbanization: Technological advancements, industrialization, immigration
- Workforce demands: Dangerous, difficult jobs; better wages than agriculture
- Immigration wave: Central, eastern, southern Europeans settling near cities
- Economic & cultural resource of growing cities (e.g., Phila, Boston, NY)
- Mid-19th century shift: Factories no longer dependent on water power/rivers
- Urban population explosion; unique industry-based city characters emerged

Common Issues Due to Rapid Expansion:
1. Housing & living conditions
2. Transportation & communication
3. Class inequalities, racial divisions, religious differences, and ethnic strife
4. Corrupt local politics

Keys to Successful Urbanization (turn of the century):
1. Electric lighting
2. Communication improvements
3. Intracity transportation
4. Rise of skyscrapers

Electric Lighting:
- Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb in 1879
- Widespread use in homes/factories from 1882 onwards
- Transformed daily life for lower-middle class Americans
- Extended factory operations 24/7, attracting more people to cities
- Cities began street illumination with electric lamps

Communication Improvements:
- Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent in 1876
- Surpassed telegraph by 1900 (1.5+ million users)
- Facilitated urban sprawl & business growth
- Instant communication over larger distances
- Rapid pace of demand, greater production, and labor needs

### Intracity Transportation

Intracity Transportation:
- Challenge: efficient travel within cities (home-factory-shop)
- Infrastructure: focused on connecting cities
- Before 1880s: omnibuses - horse-drawn carriages on iron/steel tracks
- Late 19th century: crowded cities, horses' limitations & waste issues

Inventions & Improvements:
- 1887: Frank Sprague - electric trolley (like omnibus but powered by electricity)
- 1873 SF: Cable cars introduced to navigate hills
- Overcrowded cities: Elevated trains, L-Trains from 1868 NYC, Boston 1887, Chicago 1892
- Subways: Boston's began in 1897

The Rise of Skyscrapers:
- Limited space, geographic constraints, and real estate costs prompted upward growth
- Steel construction techniques enabled greater heights, but needed elevators for practicality
- Otis Elevator Company installed first electric elevator in 1889, skyscraper craze ensued

Defining "American": Jacob Riis's work on urban poverty (How the Other Half Lives, 1890)
- Revealed slum conditions to a shocked public
- Initiated reforms against immoral landlords and harmful laws
- New York tenements: densely populated (up to 800 per square acre)

Immediate Challenges of Urban Life:
- Congestion, pollution, crime, disease, poor living conditions
- Sewage pumping systems introduced from late 1880s in major cities
- Fire hazards and overcrowded tenement houses common
- Religious organizations like churches, Salvation Army, YMCA provided relief
- Settlement House Movement (Jane Addams & Lillian Wald): education, healthcare, libraries, daycare for working-class women; later political agenda on housing, child labor, workers’ rights laws.

Discrimination & Anti-immigration Legislation:
- Demographic shift noticed by Dillingham Commission in 1907 report.
- Discrimination based on race, religion, and unfamiliarity.

  - Elevated railroads, like Chicago's L, allowed further expansion into skyline-constrained cities.
  - Increased mobility and convenience for working-class and middle-class city dwellers.
  - Stimulated population growth in previously inaccessible areas, driving urban sprawl.
  - Reduced travel time between home, work, and leisure opportunities.

Social Impacts:
1. Working Class:

2. Middle Class:
  - Affordable access to suburban areas with improved housing and schools, further social distinction.
  - Increased mobility offered new career prospects as the city's job market expanded.

3. Urban Growth:
  - Transportation advancements enabled cities to expand physically while retaining functionality.
  - Spurred growth of suburbs as middle-class populations sought better living conditions, impacting city demographics and infrastructure requirements.
  - Challenged city planners to accommodate rapid urbanization, leading to innovative solutions and architectural advancements.
