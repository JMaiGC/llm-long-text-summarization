Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900
Introduction
- Sadie Frowne's arrival in the United States showcased the opportunities and challenges of urban life.
- Many Americans came seeking a better future, but found hardships instead.
Urbanization and Its Challenges
- Rapid industrialization led to a need for large numbers of workers and the development of cities near factories.
- Immigrants from various backgrounds flocked to urban areas in search of jobs, creating cultural melting pots.
- Cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, and New York experienced significant population growth due to employment opportunities.
Universal Problems of Rapid Expansion
- Challenges included housing and living conditions, transportation, communication, class inequality, race, religion, ethnic strife, and corrupt politics.
Keys to Successful Urbanization
- Four innovations proved critical in shaping urbanization at the turn of the century: electric lighting, communication improvements, intracity transportation, and skyscrapers.
Electric Lighting
- The incandescent light bulb was patented by Thomas Edison in 1879.
- Electric power became available in cities through commercial power plants and Tesla's AC system for Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company.
- Electric lights allowed factories to run 24/7, increasing production and demand for workers.
Communication Improvements
- The telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, revolutionized communication nationally and regionally.
- By 1900, over 1.5 million telephones were in use around the country.
- Telephone networks facilitated urban sprawl and increased business activity through more rapid demand fulfillment.
Impact on Urban Growth
- Demand for additional labor from expanding businesses contributed to urban growth.

### Intracity Transportation

**Intracity Transportation**: In cities with growing sprawl, efficient travel became a major challenge. Prior transportation infrastructure connected cities, so the focus was on transporting goods and people from one city to another. Before the 1880s, omnibuses were the primary mode of transportation within cities. However, they lacked the ability to handle large crowds, which led to problems like traffic congestion and horse manure accumulation.

**Emergence of Modern Transportation Systems**: In 1887, Frank Sprague introduced the electric trolley, which was a significant improvement over omnibuses as it could operate throughout the day and night. Cable cars also emerged in cities like San Francisco to navigate steep hills. As large cities continued to grow and became more crowded, trolleys struggled with efficiency, so elevated trains (L-trains) were built above streets to avoid congestion. The final evolution of transportation was the subway, which started with Boston's system in 1897 and quickly spread to other cities.

**The Rise of Skyscrapers**: As more space was needed due to land constraints and high real estate costs, skyscrapers became a popular solution. The Otis Elevator Company introduced the electric elevator in 1889, which made taller buildings viable and led to the skyscraper craze.

**Urban Challenges**: Cities faced various challenges during this period, such as congestion, pollution, crime, and disease. Living conditions for working-class people were poor, with overcrowded tenement houses and a lack of sanitation facilities leading to epidemics. Churches, civic organizations, and the settlement house movement provided relief and community services to help address these issues.

**The Settlement House Movement**: Founded by Jane Addams in 1889 with Hull House, this movement aimed to improve living conditions for working-class women and their families. It offered services like daycare, classes, libraries, and healthcare. The success of the settlement house movement led to the creation of housing laws, child labor laws, and worker's compensation laws, among others.

**Key Figures**: Frank Sprague invented the electric trolley; Jacob Riis was a reformer who documented the living conditions of the working poor in New York City through his book "How the Other Half Lives"; Washington Gladden preached the social gospel and advocated for social change; Jane Addams founded Hull House, which became a model for settlement houses throughout the country; and Florence Kelley was an influential figure in child labor laws.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

**19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European+ Immigration**

* Factors prompting African American and European immigration to cities: Push factors (escaping racism, violence, persecution) and pull factors (job opportunities, better living conditions)
* Destinations of African Americans: Northeast and Upper Midwest cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc.
* African Americans' jobs: Menial and semi-skilled occupations; women in garment industry or domestic work
* European immigrants: Mostly from southern/eastern Europe, coming to escape famine, persecution, or military service
* Ellis Island: Main port of entry for European immigrants, processing over nine million people between 1900-1910
* Anti-immigration legislation: American Protective Association, English literacy test (passed in 1917), Chinese Exclusion Act, Emergency Quota Act (1921), Immigration Act (1924), and National Origins Act

### 19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life

19.3 Relief from the Chaos of Urban Life:
- Different classes of Americans faced urban life challenges differently
- Working class: machine politics and popular culture, e.g., Coney Island amusement parks, vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, baseball
- Middle class: higher education opportunities, suburbanization, cultural pursuits like classical music concerts and fine art museums
- Upper class: maintained luxurious lifestyles through private clubs, travel to Europe, exclusive social gatherings, and The Social Register (annual directory of wealthy socialites)
- Machine politics provided fast solutions to citizens but involved corruption
- Popular culture offered immediate escapes from urban struggles, such as amusement parks, vaudeville shows, nickelodeons, and baseball games

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

**A New Middle Class:** The emerging middle class included professionals such as managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, and accountants who were better educated and compensated than the working-class poor. They responded to urban challenges through education and suburbanization.

**Suburbanization:** With transportation improvements, more people moved to the suburbs, where they could work in the city and return home in a relatively quick and cheap way thanks to trains or trolleys. The automobile further expanded this trend with Henry Ford's lower prices allowing families to own cars.

**New Roles for Middle-Class Women:** They took pride in maintaining a positive home environment, leading to the creation of magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping. Some women also found paths to college as a few men's colleges began to admit women, while co-education became an option. The first women's colleges were founded during this period.

**Education and the Middle Class:** As professional class children didn't need to work to support their families, they had opportunities for education and advancement that solidified their position in the middle class. Public school enrollment exploded, with larger schools employing more specialized teachers and high schools growing in number. The Morrill Acts provided funding for affordable land-grant colleges. College curricula focused on preparing students for professional careers.

**"City Beautiful" Movement:** Middle-class reformers sought to improve quality of life for city dwellers by cultivating middle-and upper-class dominated urban spaces. The Columbian Exposition introduced the idea of perfect city planning, encouraging larger parks, wider boulevards with greenery, and the development of more suburbs to mitigate congestion in cities.
