# Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 
## Introduction

**Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900**

**Introduction:**
- Rapid urbanization in the U.S. during late 19th century due to industrialization, new technologies, and immigration.
- Many faced challenges despite promises of a land of opportunity.
- Sadie Frowne's experience as an example of immigrants' experiences with urban life's difficulties.

**Urbanization and Its Challenges:**
1. **Reasons for Urban Growth:**
   - Industrialization and technological advancements (steam engine, electric lights)
   - Job opportunities drawing laborers from agriculture and immigration
2. **Challenges Faced:**
   - Low wages, long hours, monotonous work
   - Overcrowded housing, poor sanitation, widespread disease
   - Language, class, race, and ethnicity barriers
3. **Universal Problems:**
   - Housing and living conditions
   - Transportation
   - Communication
   - Deep class inequalities, racial divisions, religious differences, and ethnic strife
   - Corrupt local politics

**Keys to Successful Urbanization:**
1. **Electric Lighting:**
   - Thomas Edison's incandescent bulb (1879)
   - Transformed urban life with widespread availability in cities
   - Extended production hours, attracted more workers and population growth
2. **Communication Improvements:**
   - Telephone (patented 1876) replaced telegraph as preferred communication method
   - Instant long-distance communication enabled urban sprawl and increased business demand
3. **Intracity Transportation:**
   - Necessary to address growing cities' transportation needs
4. **Rise of Skyscrapers:**
   - Allowed for densely populated vertical living and office spaces

**Urbanization Process:**
- Pre-industrial era cities (Philadelphia, Boston) grew slowly due to water dependency and seasonal production
- Rapid population growth in mid-1800s as factories located near urban centers and steam engines replaced water power
- Cities developed unique industries defining their character (Pittsburgh: steel; Chicago: meat packing; New York: garment and financial industries)
- Urban expansion brought challenges, including housing, transportation, communication, and deep class inequalities

**Innovations Shaping Urbanization:**
1. **Electric Lighting:**
   - Transformed living conditions for lower-to-middle classes
   - Extended working hours, attracted more workers and population growth
2. **Communication Improvements:**
   - Telephone enabled rapid long-distance communication
   - Increased business demand, resulting in greater production and labor requirements
3. **Intracity Transportation:**
   - Addresses urban mobility needs as cities expanded
4. **Rise of Skyscrapers:**
   - Allows for densely populated vertical living and office spaces
   - Facilitates efficient use of land in expanding cities

**City Development:**
- Pittsburgh: Steel industry
- Chicago: Meat packing
- New York: Garment and financial industries
- Detroit: Automobile manufacturing
- Urbanization shaped by core industries, but all faced common challenges, including housing, transportation, communication, deep class inequalities, racial divisions, religious differences, and ethnic strife.

**Impact of Innovations:**
1. **Electric Lighting:**
   - Transformed work patterns and urban life
2. **Communication Improvements:**
   - Enabled faster business transactions and increased demand for goods and services
3. **Intracity Transportation:**
   - Addresses mobility needs as cities expand
4. **Rise of Skyscrapers:**
   - Facilitates efficient use of land in expanding cities

**Barriers to Urban Success:**
- Deep class inequalities, racial divisions, religious differences, and ethnic strife
- Corrupt local politics exacerbated these challenges.

### Intracity Transportation

**Urban Challenges and Innovations:**

1. **Efficient Intracity Transportation:**
   - Omnibuses (large horse-drawn carriages on tracks) inadequate for larger, congested cities due to horse rest requirements and manure buildup.
   - Electric trolleys (1887) introduced as solution: larger wagons on tracks powered by electricity instead of horses, allowing continuous operation and reducing reliance on horses and manure.
   - Cable cars (San Francisco, 1873) utilizing pulley technology to overcome hilly terrain and make steep areas accessible.
   - Elevated trains (L-trains, from 1868) raised above streets to avoid congestion and enable efficient movement through crowded cities.
   - Subways (Boston, 1897) eventually replaced elevated lines as urban centers grew vertically with skyscrapers.
2. **The Rise of Skyscrapers:**
   - Limited urban expansion due to geographic constraints and the need for proximity to workplaces, shops, and institutions led to upward growth.
   - Steel construction techniques enabled taller buildings, but elevators (first electric in 1889 by Otis Elevator Company) were required to make tall buildings viable and attractive for businesses.
3. **Improving Living Conditions:**
   - Congestion, pollution, crime, and disease were prevalent problems in urban centers, with atrocious living conditions for working-class residents.
   - Reformers like Jacob Riis documented squalor through photographs and lectures, leading to new legislation curbing tenement abuses.
   - Churches and civic organizations provided relief and support through social gospel philosophy, offering community services, education, and advocacy.
   - Settlement houses (from 1880s) established to help working-class women and families with childcare, education, health care, and employment opportunities.
4. **Jacob Riis and Social Reform:**
   - Danish immigrant and police reporter who exposed living conditions of New York's working poor through photographs and lectures in How the Other Half Lives (1890).
   - Effective storyteller using drama and racial stereotypes but also a reformer advocating for improved tenements and remedies to poverty.
5. **Settlement Houses and Progressive Reform:**
   - Pioneering women like Jane Addams (Chicago) and Lillian Wald (New York) led the settlement house movement, creating community centers for working-class immigrants and women.
   - Offered services such as childcare, evening classes, libraries, gym facilities, and free health care to help alleviate the challenges of urban life.
   - Influenced political agenda, leading to housing laws, child labor laws, worker's compensation laws, and women's suffrage activism.
6. **Urban Innovations Overcoming Challenges:**
   - Transportation: omnibuses, electric trolleys, cable cars, elevated trains, and subways.
   - Architecture and construction: skyscrapers and elevators.
   - Social services and reforms: churches, civic organizations, settlement houses, and advocacy groups.

### MY STORY. Jane Addams Reflects on the Settlement House Movement

**Jane Addams' Reflections on the Settlement House Movement (Hull House)**

**Founder and Social Activist**

- Accessibility: making opportunities for growth and development available to everyone, regardless of background or means.

**Additional Notes**

- Hull House inspired similar initiatives throughout the US and influenced modern social work and community development efforts.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

**African American Great Migration**

- Nearly 2 million African Americans migrated from the South to Northeast and Upper Midwest between 1865 and 1900. ([_Three Cities_: New York, Chicago, Philadelphia] [_Six Cities_: St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Indianapolis])
- Push factors: racial violence, lack of voting rights, and discrimination.
- Pull factors: job opportunities, higher wages, and freedom from violence.
- Settled in cities due to lack of funds to move west and seek land.
- Most worked in unskilled or semi-skilled occupations (steel mills, mines, construction, meat packing, railroads, domestic work).
- Higher wages and more available housing compared to the South.
- Discrimination and limited education relegated African Americans to lower-paying jobs.

**New European Immigration**

- Over 80% of New York City population foreign-born or children of foreign-born by 1890.

- Inspections for infectious diseases and criminal history upon arrival.
- Discrimination against "newer" immigrants due to easily identifiable differences (darker skin tone, unfamiliar languages, religions, foods).
- Backlash from Americans resentful of job competition and overcrowding led to hatred and discrimination.

**Factors Prompting African American and European Immigration**

- **African Americans:** Push: violence, lack of voting rights, discrimination. Pull: job opportunities, freedom from violence, higher wages.
