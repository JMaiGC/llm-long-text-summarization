### Chapter 19 - The Growing Pains of Urbanization, 1870-1900 Introduction

Chapter 19 Summary - The Growing Pains of Urbanization (1870-1900)

Introductory Context:
- Sadie Frowne's narrative exemplifies immigrants' experiences during urban transition in the US
- Seeking better opportunities, they faced numerous challenges such as language barriers, socioeconomic struggles, and health risks

19.1 Urbanization Challenges & Solutions:
- Rapid American city growth due to industrialization advancements and mass immigration from Europe
- Immigration resulted in ethnic clusters seeking familiarity but intensified problems of poverty, low wages, crowded housing, poor sanitation, and diseases
- Key challenges' mitigation relied on addressing issues surrounding language, class, race, and ethnicity; improvements in communication, transportation, electric lighting, and infrastructure development were crucial

Urban Population Expansion & Industry Profiles:
- Urban population boom after mid-1800s due to industrialization progress; factories no longer reliant on waterways led movement toward cities
- Industries shaped cities' identities: Pittsburgh (steel), Chicago (meat packing), NYC (garment and finance), Detroit (autos)

Common Urban Struggles Independent of Industry:
- Challenges faced due to fast urbanization included housing, transportation, communication concerns
- Rooted in deep class divisions accentuated by race, religion, ethnicity disparities; local politics often corrupt

Keys to Successful Urbanization (Turn of Century):
1. Electric Lighting: Edison's incandescent light bulb led to widespread availability and transformed living standards
2. Communication Improvements: Telephone adoption increased business pace through instant nationwide communication
3. Intracity Transportation Development
4. Rise of Skyscrapers: Skyscrapers solved space constraints in urban areas by allowing buildings to reach great heights

Despite difficulties, cities thrived due to innovation and necessity amidst rapid growth.<|im_end|>

### Intracity Transportation

Intracity Transportation Evolution:
- Challenge of efficient travel within cities emerged with urban growth.
- Most infra focused on connecting cities, omnibuses addressed intracity needs until 1880s.
   - Large horse-drawn carriages placed on iron/steel tracks for smoother rides.
   - Limited to smaller cities without heavy congestion.

Electric Trolley Invention (Frank Sprague, 1887):
- Similar concept as omnibuses but powered by electricity instead of horses.
- Operated throughout day & night like factories and workers.
- Modernized industrial centers such as Richmond, VA.

Cable Cars (San Francisco, 1873):
- Used pulley tech from mining industry to tackle steep hills.
- Elevated cities' middle class communities.

Elevated Trains/L-Trains Development:
- Addressing congestion challenges in major cities like Chicago & NYC (from 1868 NYC).
- Subways followed as skyscrapers limited surface space for transport infrastructure.
   - Boston's subway system started in 1897, followed by NYC and others.

Urban Skyscraper Rise:
- Overcoming city size limitations due to land scarcity or geographic barriers.
- Steel construction techniques facilitated height growth but required elevator invention.
   - Otis Electric Elevator Co.'s first installation in 1889 initiated skyscraper craze.

"American" Identity Shaping with Jacob Riis:
- Danish immigrant documented NYC slums, reformed public perception of poor living conditions.
   - Called for remodeling tenements or building new ones amidst concerns from fellow activists/reporters.

Urban Life Challenges:
- Congestion, pollution, crime, disease prevalent in all urban centers.
- Horrific living conditions for working-class urban dwellers in crowded tenement houses.
   - High rates of cholera, typhoid, etc., due to poor sanitation systems before sewage pumping adoption (1870s-90s).
   - Average working-class family lived in two-bedroom tenements with up to eight hundred residents per square acre in densely populated areas.

Relief Efforts:
- Churches offered community services, advocated social change via social gospel philosophy (Reverend Washington Gladden).
   - Provided gymnasiums/libraries, evening classes on hygiene & healthcare.
- Religious organizations like Salvation Army, YMCA expanded urban reach providing community service to poor.
- Settlement House Movement (1890s): Jane Addams (Hull House, Chicago) & Lillian Wald (NYC's Henry Street Settlement).
   - Offered aid for working women incl. childcare, evening classes, libraries/gym facilities, healthcare. Spread across cities.
- Led to political agendas pushing housing laws, child labor laws, worker compensation laws, etc.

### 19.2 The African American “Great Migration” and New European

THE AFRICAN AMERICAN "GREAT MIGRATION":
- Period between Civil War end & Great Depression
- Nearly 2 million Africans Americans leave rural South
- Main destinations: Northeast/Upper Midwest cities (NY, Chicago, Phila...)
- Combination of push/pull factors driving migration
  - Push: Racial hatred, KKK rise, violence & lynchings
  - Pull: Job opportunities, voting rights hopes
- Factory owners assisted migration; men moved first then families later
- Low skilled jobs dominated African American workforce (steel mills, mines...)
- Women found fewer job opportunities but worked as maids/domestic servants
- Afr. Americans earned higher wages in North & housing accessibility improved

NEW EUROPEAN IMMIGRATION:
- S & E European immigrants replaced N/W Europeans
- Motivations similar to African Americans' reasons for migration
  - Push: Famines, persecution, escape military service
  - Pull: Consistent wage earning opportunities in US cities
- Arrived with lower education/funds than previous waves
- Settled in port towns rather than western lands
- Ellis Island processed immigrants from 1892; over 9 million arrived 1900-1910
- Doctors inspected immigrants for diseases; around 2% denied entry due to health or criminal records
- Dillingham Commission reported ethnic differences led to discrimination against new immigrants
- Immigrants blamed for economic struggles; anti-immigration groups emerged (APA)
  - Resulted in legislation like English literacy test for immigrants (1917), Chinese Exclusion Act & later quota acts <|im_end|>

### A NEW MIDDLE CLASS While the working class were confined to tenement houses in the cities by their need to be close to their work and the lack of fund

**A NEW MIDDLE CLASS**: Emerged in response to urban challenges; managers, salesmen, engineers, doctors, accountants comprised this group with better education and compensation than working class but still worked for a living.

Relief from cities came through **EDUCATION AND SUBURBANIZATION**. Transportation advancements allowed middle class commuting while ownership of cars expanded suburban possibilities. Interstate highways and low-interest loans further fueled suburban growth.

**NEW ROLES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS WOMEN**: Social norms pushed women to create a positive home environment. Ladies' Home Journal & Good Housekeeping gained popularity catering to this focus on maintaining a respectable home. While most became housewives, some pursued higher education and career paths in teaching or settlement houses.

First women's colleges opened during late 1800s - Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith & Wellesley College, providing unique all-female educational environments. Despite initial low enrollment, these schools offered opportunities for further education and careers outside homemaking.

**EDUCATION AND THE MIDDLE CLASS**: Children received more education due to lack of work obligation; public school attendance tripled from 7M in 1870 to 21M by 1920, with improved infrastructure and focus on specialized teachers and courses. High schools saw significant growth as well. The Morrill Acts funded land-grant colleges, making higher education more accessible for the middle class with a focus on practical professions.

**CITY BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENT**: Aimed at improving quality of life in urban areas while cultivating middle/upper-class spaces. Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham spearheaded this movement showcased at Columbian Exposition's 'White City'. Main principles included larger parks, wider boulevards with greenery, and expanding suburbs to alleviate city congestion. These ideas influenced urban development well into the 20th century.
