**Chapter 9: The Second Pillar - Metacognitive Interventions for Attachment Disturbances**

- Discusses four generations of metacognitive approaches to treating attachment disturbances
- **Second Generation:** Developed Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)

**Metacognitive Approaches**

- Focus on the individual's thoughts, feelings, and mental processes
- Aim to improve self-awareness and understanding of mental states

**First Generation:** Early interventions focused on cognitive restructuring and behavioral techniques.

**Second Generation:** Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)

* Developed by Peter Fonagy, Anna Freud Centre, London
* Based on attachment theory and mentalization
* Targets the ability to understand and interpret one's own and others' mental states
* Enhances reflective functioning and emotional regulation
* Consists of individual therapy, group therapy, and family sessions
* Addresses parent-child relationships and interpersonal interactions
* Goal: Help individuals develop a more flexible and accurate mentalizing capacity

**Third Generation:** Integrates mindfulness practices into metacognitive approaches.

**Fourth Generation:** Focuses on the application of metacognitive techniques in various settings, such as schools and organizations.

- MBT has shown effectiveness in treating attachment disturbances and related disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder)
- Continuous research and development in metacognitive interventions for attachment issues

### This approach serves to develop a general capacity for reflective function in patients, which in turn increases overall coherence of mind. There is im

### PART 1 FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS CHAPTER 1 Attachment Research A History of Ideas

**Part 1: Foundational Concepts**

**Chapter 1: Attachment Research**

- The study of attachment research has evolved from various seminal ideas, observations, and research.
- Early understanding of attachment focused on the negative effects of disruptions to early attachment processes.

**Maternal Deprivation**

- Studies in the 1930s highlighted the deleterious effects of institutionalization on infants.
  * Harry Harlow's research on rhesus monkeys (not included in text) also contributed to understanding maternal deprivation.
- Infants in institutions exhibited arrested development, poor health, and difficulty forming attachments.
- René Spitz coined the term "hospitalism" to describe the effects of institutional deprivation.
- Films documenting the effects of maternal separation were produced, illustrating the problematic effects on children's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development.

**Effects of Separation from Parents**

- Studies on hospitalized children and foster care revealed the importance of continuity between a child and parents.
  * Robertson identified three stages in children's experience of separation: protest, despair, and detachment.
- Children in foster care exhibited anxious behaviors following separation from birth parents and a combination of clinging and rejection during visits by the father.

**Primary Affect Hunger**

- David Levy described children who experienced significant disruptions in parental care during their formative years.
  * These children had difficulty forming attachments to subsequent foster or adoptive parents.
- Levy introduced the concept of "primary affect hunger," which refers to the need for a full spectrum of human feelings arising from daily interaction with a mother.

**Key Concepts:** Maternal deprivation, hospitalism, protest, despair, detachment, primary affect hunger.

### As a way of understanding the behavioral and developmental problems observed in children in institutional and foster care, more and more researchers b

**Maternal Deprivation and Its Effects on Children's Development**

- Researchers shifted focus from separation to maternal deprivation during separation.
- Karen (1998): Calamitous effects of no true attachment, lack of alternative mother figure, or repeated losses leading to bitterness and mistrust.

**Maternal Care and Mental Health (Bowlby, 1951)**

- Important monograph for WHO on the impact of parental care on mental health.
- Emphasized the significance of early emotional environment on child development.
- Ideal quality of care: warm, intimate, continuous relationship between infant and mother (or permanent substitute) where both find satisfaction and enjoyment.
- Maternal deprivation: inadequate experience of such a relationship adversely affects mental health.

**Maternal Deprivation and Home Disruption**

- Separation is most obvious cause, but maternal deprivation can occur at home with an unresponsive mother.
- Criticized the concept of "broken home" – disrupted attachment bond is essential cause of mental health problems.

**Problems in Parent-Child Dynamic**

- Unconsciously rejecting attitude by parent.
- Excessive demand for love and reassurance from parent.
- Parent gets unconscious vicarious gratification from child's acting out.

**Findings on Maternal Deprivation**

- Bakwin, Bender, Spitz, Levy: frequent or prolonged separations before age 2.5 without substitute figure contribute to mental health problems and character development issues.
- Prolonged deprivation of maternal care can have grave and far-reaching effects on a child's future.

### The Development of the Concept of the Attachment Bond

**The Development of the Concept of Attachment Bond**

* John Bowlby was influenced by Konrad Lorenz's work on imprinting in birds (1937) and its similarities to human infant-mother bonds.
* Bowlby believed that attachment behavior in humans, like imprinting in animals, is not solely dependent on feeding but rather on instinctual patterns.
* He identified a set of innate fixed action patterns or "attachment behaviors" in human infants, including caregiver-signaling behaviors.
* Attachment behavior is defined as any behavior that results in a person attaining or maintaining proximity to a specific individual and serves the function of maintenance of proximity for protection and survival.
* Harlow's research on attachment in primates (1958) provided evidence that soft contact is more important than feeding for attachment development.
* Attachment behavior is highly specific, care-seeking, and primarily associated with forming, maintaining, reacting to disruption of, and reestablishing attachment bonds.
* Bowlby proposed a four-stage model of attachment development: indiscriminate orientation, orientation toward a specific caregiver, proximity-maintaining behavior, and goal-corrected partnership.
* The concept of attachment differs from dependence; while dependence diminishes with age, attachment is not present at birth but emerges around six months.
* Mother's availability and responsiveness are essential for the strengthening of the attachment bond.
* Attachment behavior and exploratory behavior interplay: securely attached children alternate between episodes of attachment behavior and exploratory behavior, while alarmed children exhibit proximity-seeking attachment behaviors.
* Ideally, when an exploring baby becomes alarmed, the mother responds with retrieving behavior to bring the child back to safety.

### Patterns of Attachment

**Mary Ainsworth's Attachment Theory**

- Influenced by William Blatz's personality theory, focusing on emotional security from parents
- Concept of secure base: caregiver provides stability and consistency for exploration and security
- Securely attached infants exhibit behaviors like smiling, cooing, crying, greeting, etc.
- Observed infant-parent interactions in Uganda (1954) and identified secure attachment phases
  - Undiscriminating phase: no preferential response to caregiver
  - Differential responsiveness: clear preference for primary attachment figure
  - Secure base behavior: crying when mother leaves, clapping or cooing on return
  - Active initiative: distinct proximity-seeking behaviors
  - Stranger anxiety
- Noted nonattached and insecurely attached infants in Uganda study
- Started second observational study in Baltimore (1960s) to further investigate attachment patterns
- American infants showed less secure base behavior, less protest, and less stranger anxiety due to cultural differences in parenting
- Developed Strange Situation method (1970s) for studying attachment in unfamiliar settings
  - Eight distinct episodes: introduction, mother-infant interaction, stranger enters, first separation, first reunion, second separation, second reunion, and conclusion.

### The entire sequence is designed to assess infants’ attachment behavior and exploratory behavior as well as to see the interplay of these behaviors in 

**The Strange Situation Procedure**

- Designed by Ainsworth et al. (1978) to assess infant attachment and exploratory behavior in various conditions
- Secure base hypothesis: high exploratory behavior with mother present, low attachment behavior; reverse during separation and reunion
- Observed 106 white, middle-class one-year-olds and their mothers
- Infants' behaviors coded into twelve categories and four dimensions
- Normative results confirmed main hypotheses
- Three major patterns of attachment behavior identified:
  * Group A: avoidance of mother with significant resistance to contact
  * Group B: secure attachment with balanced interplay of exploratory and attachment behavior
  * Group C: ambivalent attachment with strong resistance to contact and heightened anxiety
- Group C infants had less exploratory behavior, lower developmental quotient, and were chronically anxious in relation to the mother
- Subgroups within each group found, but sample sizes were small.

**Hypotheses and Design**

* Assess infant–mother attachment behaviors and patterns
* Address hypothesis of infants exploring unfamiliar environment with mother present but slowing down or ceasing exploration in her absence
* Observe distress upon separation and responses to a stranger
* Use Strange Situation Procedure (SS) to investigate interplay between attachment and exploratory behavior in an unfamiliar situation.

**Procedures and Observations**

- Infants and mothers observed in SS through one-way mirror
- Twelve specific behaviors coded: locomotion, body movement, body posture, hand movements, visual regard, location, adult contact behavior, baby contact behavior, crying, vocalization, oral behavior, smiling
- Four dimensions of interactive sequences coded: proximity-and contact-seeking behavior, contact-maintaining behavior, avoidance, and resistance.

**Results**

* Normative results confirmed main hypotheses: exploratory behavior high with mother present, attachment behavior low; reverse during separation and reunion
* Group A infants showed avoidance of mother and significant resistance to physical contact
* Securely attached infants (Group B) showed greater proximity-seeking and contact-seeking toward the mother than the stranger
* Ambivalent infants (Group C) cried significantly more during separation episodes and displayed simultaneous occurrence of both resistant and proximity-and contact-seeking behavior.

**Findings on Group C Infants**

* Less exploratory behavior in general and less interest in toys during an exploratory episode
* Lower developmental quotient than babies from other groups
* Chronically anxious in relation to the mother and showed heightened attachment behavior and inhibited exploratory behavior.

### This classification suggests that from B3, considered the prototype of a securely attached baby, there are gradations of avoidant and ambivalent patte

**Attachment Classification**

* Ainsworth et al. (1978) identified three attachment patterns: Secure (B), Anxious-Avoidant (A), and Anxious-Resistant or Ambivalent (C) based on infant behavior in the Strange Situation (SS) test.
* **Secure Attachment (B)**
  * B1 and B2 infants are subgroups of secure attachment, with B1 showing less proximity-seeking in second reunion episode and inconsistent maternal sensitivity.
  * B3 infants have an almost complete lack of avoidance and resistance, cry less, and mothers are the most sensitive to their signals.
* **Anxious-Avoidant Attachment (A)**
  * A1 babies show less proximity-seeking and stronger avoidance in reunion episodes, mothers are more rejecting and interfering.
  * A2 babies' mothers are inaccessible for long periods, infants are identical to B1 but with less proximity-seeking in second reunion episode.
* **Anxious-Resistant or Ambivalent Attachment (C)**
  * C1 babies show strong resistance in reunion episodes, mothers are interfering and controlling.
  * C2 babies are significantly more passive than all other groups, have very weak exploratory behavior, and mothers are inaccessible and ignoring.

**Home Study**

* Ainsworth et al. observed a subsample of infants at home to determine if attachment patterns manifested similarly in unfamiliar and familiar environments.
* Group B babies at home showed little crying, infrequent separation distress, frequent positive greetings, initiation of close bodily contact, and better-developed modes of communication.
* Groups A and C babies were characterized by relatively more crying, more separation distress, disturbances related to close bodily contact, and more anger.

**Maternal Behavior and Attachment Patterns**

* Maternal behavior was observed in relation to crying, acknowledgement upon entering the room, quality of touch, physical contact, face-to-face interactions, verbal commands, discipline-oriented physical interventions, feeding, and general maternal characteristics.
* Group B babies' mothers were more affectionate during physical contact, tender when holding their babies, responsive to crying, sensitive, accepting, cooperative, and accessible.
* Group A babies' mothers were more rejecting of their babies, showed less positive feelings and more anger toward their babies, were less affectionate in picking up their babies, had greater aversion and aberrant reactions to physical contact with their babies, were abrupt and interfering when picking up their babies, gave more verbal commands, and delivered more physical interventions for discipline.
* Group C babies' mothers showed significant delay or unresponsiveness to their babies' crying, were more involved in routine activities when holding their babies, and struggled when feeding their babies. Overall, Group C mothers were notably insensitive to their infant’s signals.

**Changes in Attachment and Exploratory Behavior from Ages One to Four**

* Two-year-olds showed stronger proximity-seeking but did not need to maintain contact as strongly.
* Three-year-olds were not very disturbed by separation episodes and maintained a high level of exploratory behavior throughout the SS.
* Four-year-olds were even less disturbed by separation than three-year-olds and had even stronger exploratory behavior than three-year-olds.
* The goal-corrected partnership between mother and child increased from age one to age four.

### Disorganized Attachment

**Disorganized Attachment**

- A fourth primary classification group identified by Ainsworth and her associates and later researchers
- Children did not fit the three patterns of attachment: avoidant, secure, and ambivalent
- Initially seen as unclassifiable, but Main developed a scale to assess disorganized behaviors in the Strange Situation (SS) in the 1970s
- Disorganized/disoriented (D) children lacked a coherent strategy for dealing with separation stress and showed contradictory attachment behaviors
- During SS, these children displayed misdirected and interrupted movements, fear, apprehension, and disorientation

**Main's Interpretation of Disorganized Behaviors**

- Indicates a lack of consistent and coherent attachment strategy
- 80% interrater reliability for identifying disorganized attachment from the SS

**Crittenden's Interpretation of Disorganized Behaviors**

- Represents an organized strategy for maximizing need-fulfillment in specific relational circumstances
- Emerges in maltreated children as a response to inconsistent reactions from caregivers
- Labeled as "A/C" pattern, with any subtype of the A and C patterns combined
- Later refined into an "AC" pattern, where A and C strategies are blended and simultaneously manifest

**Differences in Interpretation**

- Ainsworth supported both Main's and Crittenden's understandings, seeing them as complementary rather than conflicting
- Differences based on interpretation of organized vs. disorganized behaviors and populations studied

**Consequences of Attachment Trauma**

- Can be seen as adaptation (Crittenden's perspective) or absence of an organized strategy (Main's perspective)

**Limitations of the Traditional CC Category**

- Our approach expands and refines the CC scoring system rather than dropping it entirely
- Nine subcategories of CC identified from applying AAI to clinical populations with severe psychiatric disturbances.

### This combination of frightening and frightened maternal behavior presents an impossible dilemma for the baby: the object of proximity-seeking and cont

**Disorganized Attachment**

- Disorganized attachment presents an impossible dilemma for babies: seeking proximity and contact from a source of fear (Main)
- Causes:
  - Frightening and frightened maternal behavior (Main, Hesse)
  - Extreme misattunement and disrupted affective communication (Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz)
  - Maternal dissociative behavior (Schuengel et al., Main & Hesse)

**Maternal Frightening/Frightened Behavior**

- Disorganized babies seek contact but need to avoid the mother due to fear
- Mothers with unresolved trauma or loss more likely to engage in frightening/frightened behaviors when dissociated (Main & Hesse)

**Dissociative Behavior and Experiences in Children**

- Disorganized children exhibit a wider range of observable dissociative behaviors and experiences than normal children (Carlson, Liotti)
- Longitudinal studies show disorganized behavior is associated with dissociative experiences and controlling behavior throughout childhood and adolescence (Ogawa et al., Crittenden)

**Controlling Behavior in Attachment Relationships**

- Disorganized children attempt to control or direct parent's attention and behavior (Main & Cassidy)
- 84% of disorganized children at one year were seen as controlling by six years of age

**Stability of Attachment Patterns Over Time**

- Bowlby: attachment patterns become relatively stable over childhood, adolescence, and adulthood through internalization and working models
- Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children investigates stability of attachment patterns, effects on personality development, and parenting style effects
- Stability of attachment classification from 18 months to 20 years: 72%-77% (Solomon & George)

### Attachment and the Organization of Development

**Attachment and Development:** Sroufe's Minnesota Longitudinal Study investigated the organization, continuity, and change in development from birth to adulthood with an "organizational perspective," focusing on how behavior changes over time define individual differences. Central to their work was the belief that early experiences play a critical role in shaping the person.

**Study Overview:** The study followed 179 low-income mothers and their children until adulthood, assessing prenatal factors, poverty, age-by-age development, comprehensive measures across domains, normal versus maladaptive development, developmental context, and early relationships.

**Attachment Assessments:** The Strange Situation (SS) assessment was given to infants at 12 months and 18 months, and the Adult Attachment Interview was administered at ages 19 and 26. At 12 months, 22% were resistant (ambivalent), 20% avoidant, and no disorganized attachment category was available at that time.

**Attachment Categories:**
- **Secure Attachment:** Not present in the data provided.
- **Resistant/Ambivalent Attachment:** 22% of infants at 12 months.
- **Avoidant Attachment:** 20% of infants at 12 months.
- **Disorganized Attachment:** Not assessed until post hoc analysis from videotapes.

**Change in Attachment:** Secure children were less distressed by separation and needed less physical contact as they grew older, becoming more autonomous and comfortable around peers.

**Assessment of Early Relationships:** The study assessed various forms of abuse (physical, sexual, psychological unavailability, verbal) in a high-risk sample.

**Methodology:** The SS was given multiple times throughout childhood, and the Adult Attachment Interview was administered twice in adulthood to understand attachment patterns and their development over time.

### Bowlby and Ainsworth:

**Bowlby and Ainsworth's Hypotheses:**

- Longitudinal study affirmed Bowlby's hypothesis that quality of care impacts attachment quality (Sroufe et al., 2005)
- Supported Ainsworth's findings on caregiver responsivity's relation to attachment relationship quality in the first year

**Study Overview:**

- Intensive observations of children in a research preschool setting
- Impact of early attachment status on development throughout childhood and adulthood

**Developmental Stages:**

*Guided self-regulation (toddler years)*: Securely attached children had greater ego-resilience, higher self-esteem, and better peer relationships.

*Self-reliance (preschool years):*
  *Avoidant patterns:* Bullies, shy loners, daydreamers
  *Ambivalent attachment:* Impulsive child, fearful, clingy child

*Competency (school years)*: Securely attached children likely to grow into secure adults. Insecure children may change unless exposed to healthy attachment figures.

*Individuation (adolescence):* Insecure attachment correlated with depression and anxiety disorders.

*Emancipation (early adulthood):* Avoidantly attached children had externalizing problems, conduct disorders. Disorganized children showed dissociative experiences unless abused as children.

**Longitudinal Findings:**

- Securely attached children likely to remain securely attached in adulthood
- Insecure children may retain insecurity into adulthood or change with healthy attachment figures
- Insecure attachment correlated with depression, attention deficits, anxiety disorders, and conduct disorders
- Disorganized attachment in infancy linked to psychopathology in early adulthood
- History of disorganized attachment and abuse linked to self-injurious behavior

### Counterpoints

**Counterpoints to Attachment Theory**

* Michael Lamb et al. (1984) criticized Ainsworth's research on the Strange Situation (SS) for small sample size and lack of videorecordings
* Findings based on SS have been replicated or partially replicated despite these limitations

**Criticisms from Jerome Kagan (1984)**

* Does not believe in stable patterns of attachment
* Believes environmental factors, including maternal sensitivity, are unimportant in child development
* Hereditary factors and temperament are primary contributors to personality development

**Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas's New York Longitudinal Study (1982)**

* Investigated effects of early infant temperament on subsequent development
* Infants classified into four groups based on temperament: difficult, slow-to-warm, easy, cannot classify
* Temperament made a significant contribution to development, but parenting style did not significantly correlate with ease or difficulty

**Responses to Kagan and Chess**

* Sroufe's Minnesota 28 Longitudinal Study: included data on heredity, temperament, and quality of early attachment
* Quality of early attachment and maternal behavior accounted for a greater portion of variance than temperament
* Belsky and Isabella (1988) found mother's temperament, not infant's temperament, correlated with infant's pattern of attachment in SS

**Conclusion**

* Both temperament and early attachment relationship contribute to later development and emergence of psychopathology in adulthood
* Four prototypical child patterns of attachment (secure, avoidant, ambivalent/resistant, disorganized) are robust findings across studies
* These patterns remain relatively stable across time unless altered by unusual life circumstances

### The Role of the Father

**The Role of the Father in Attachment**

- *Main and Weston (1981)*: Comparable rates of secure and insecure attachment to both mothers and fathers, no significant correlation between the two.
  - Secure attachment toward one parent but not the other possible.

**Research on Infant-Father Attachment**

- *Goossens and van IJzendoorn (1990)*: Small but significant effect size (0.13) for paternal sensitivity and secure attachment.
  - Smaller than maternal sensitivity's effect size.

**Factors Influencing Father as Secure Attachment Figure**

- *Lamb (1997)*: Many fathers are less involved with their babies than mothers.
- Active involvement in positive ways leads to secure attachment.

**Father's Role in Secure Attachment vs Mother's Role**

- *George & Solomon (1999)*: Differences in father and mother roles.
  - Mother: Proximity-and contact-seeking behaviors.
  - Father: Encouraging exploratory behavior.

**Father's Impact on Toddler Play and Secure Attachment**

- Consistently found to be associated with father–child secure attachment.
- *Belsky, Gilstrap, & Rovine (1984); Grossmann & Grossmann (1991)*: Father's role in quality of toddler play.

**Howes (1999)**

- Fathers who express positive feelings and prioritize time with infants have more secure infants.

### Cross-Cultural Studies of Attachment Patterns and Maternal Behavior

**Cross-Cultural Studies of Attachment Patterns and Maternal Behavior**

* Interest in universality of attachment patterns began early in the field
* Ainsworth's research compared children and mothers in Uganda and Baltimore, MD
  * Differences: Ugandan children more used to constant maternal presence, American children more used to coming and going
  * Similarities: Three main attachment patterns (A, B, C) observed in both groups
* Subsequent cross-cultural studies:

**Gusii, Kenya:**

* Older children care for babies during day, mothers at night
* Secure attachment to mothers (61%) and non-maternal caregivers not reported
* Differences in SS behavior: handshake greeting, exploratory behavior

**Hausa, Nigeria:**

* Men have multiple wives, children have multiple caregivers
* Babies remain close to caregivers due to physical danger
* Secure attachment demonstrated to multiple caregivers

**Dogon, Mali:**

* High infant mortality rate, children breast-fed on demand
* Grandparents and siblings serve as caregivers
* Total of 69% secure, 8% resistant, 0% avoidant, 23% disorganized
* Possible unresolved loss in mothers may account for high disorganized attachment rate

**!Kung bushmen and Efe rain forest pygmies:**

* Children spend more time with peers as they grow older
* Dense social networks facilitate secure attachment and healthy peer adjustment
* Preference for biological mothers, but multiple caregivers present

**Israeli kibbutz children:**

* Sleep apart from parents in communal setting
* Secure attachment lower (56%) than non-kibbutz Israeli children (75%), Western studies (65%-70%)
* Ambivalent/resistant overrepresented, avoidant underrepresented
* Non-kibbutz Israeli children raised at home show high rates of secure attachment

**Northern Germany:**

* High value placed on early independence
* Two-thirds of sample insecure, half avoidant
* Parents become less responsive to children around six months old
* Second study found comparable rates to American studies

**China:**

* One-child policy, interdependence favored over independence
* Hu and Meng's study: 68% secure, 16% avoidant, 16% resistant
* Avoidant babies indifferent to mothers during reunion episodes
* Mothers of avoidant babies generally work outside home, less involved in care
* Rural mothers work long hours, children show high rates of avoidant attachment

**Japan:**

* Encouraging dependence on mother
* Secure attachment: 61% securely attached, 18% resistant, 13% avoidant
* Mothers who feel supported by husbands more likely to raise securely attached children

**Russia:**

* Family-reared infants in St. Petersburg: only 6.2% secure
* Unstable and threatening social environment may contribute to low secure attachment rate

### Intergenerational Transmission

**Intergenerational Transmission of Attachment**

- Attachment status tends to be transmitted down through generations (Main et al., 1985; Bowlby, 1988)
  - Parent's pattern of attachment on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) correlates with baby's pattern in the Strange Situation (SS) procedure
  - Three-generational study: grandmother's attachment status on AAI predicted mother and grandchild's attachment patterns (Benoit & Parker, 1994; Hesse, 1999)

**Intergenerational Transmission Gap**

- Van IJzendoorn (1995) noted a "transmission gap" due to lack of explanation for how parent's attachment pattern becomes child's

**Factors in Intergenerational Transmission**

- **Metacognitive capacity**: missing ingredient for understanding intergenerational transmission (Wallin, 2007)
- Main and her associates explored another factor: unresolved trauma or loss

**Unresolved Trauma or Loss**

- Adults with unresolved status for a given trauma or loss show temporary disorganization in response to specific AAI topics
- Unresolved adults often have deficits in metacognitive monitoring and dissociated memories (Main & Hesse, 1990)
- Three types of phenomena associated with unresolved status: extreme beliefs, manipulations, and clinical symptoms
- Unresolved status is linked to disorganized attachment in babies (Main & Hesse, 1990, 1992)
- Parent's intense shifts in state and lapses toward disorganized states negatively affect child's development of internal working models (IWMs)

**Base Rates for Adult Attachment Pattern Classifications**

- Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn (2009) examined over 200 studies on AAI results
- North American mothers: 58% secure, 23% dismissing, 19% anxious-preoccupied (three-category classification)
- North American mothers: 56% secure, 16% dismissing, 9% anxious-preoccupied, 18% unresolved/cannot classify (four-category classification)
- North American fathers: similar to mothers for three-category classification but more dismissing in four-category classification
- European studies: similar to North American mothers when using three-category differentiation but slightly higher rate of dismissing attachment with U/CC category included
- Significant deviation from base rates in clinical populations and some countries (e.g., Russia)

### The Organization of States of Mind: Internal Working Models

**Internal Working Models (IWMs) and Attachment:**

* John Bowlby was inspired by Konrad Lorenz's work on animals' mental representations of their environment.
* Bowlby proposed that humans develop internal maps (IWMs) for attachment relationships based on experiences with caregivers.
* IWMs consist of a person's notion of self and attachment figures, forecasting accessibility and responsiveness.
* Secure IWMs are flexible and adaptable, while insecure IWMs can be rigid, distorted, contradictory, and resistant to change.
* Insecure IWMs may result from defensive exclusion of experiences, leading to multiple or contradictory models.
* An insecure IWM can be changed into a stable, secure one through effective attachment relationships or therapy (earned security).

**Mary Main's Work:**

* Mary Main, influenced by linguistics, saw that differences in attachment behavior reflect different patterns of cognitive organization.
* Secure versus insecure attachment organizations influence feelings, behavior, attention, memory, and cognition.
* IWMs are a set of rules for organizing information relevant to attachment.

**Patricia Crittenden's Dynamic-Maturational Model (DMM):**

* Focuses on the organization of mind in response to attachment experiences and danger/threat.
* Children develop coping strategies based on attachment figures' protection and their maturational level.
* Variation in attachment behavior reflects variation in patterns of information processing.
* DMM expands on Bowlby, Ainsworth, Main by emphasizing the role of threat and danger in shaping attachment patterns.

### The Dynamic-Maturational Model of attachment and adaptation defines attachment as three-entwined components: (1) relationships focused on protection a

**Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM)**

- Defines attachment as three components:
  - Relationships focused on protection and comfort
  - Patterns of mental processing of information about danger and sexual opportunity
  - Strategies for self-protection, reproduction, and protection of progeny

**Attachment as Strategy in DMM**

- Not a stable property but a strategy used to keep safe within relationships and produce the next generation
- Maladaptive behavior results from earlier attempts to protect oneself and one's progeny

**Processing Information under Threat**

- When parents do not provide adequate protection, children process information based on their zone of proximal development
- Distortions in processing preserve the function of attachment (self-protection)

**Information Processing Distortions**

- Two primary forms:
  - Omitting affective information and privileging cognitive information
  - Omitting cognitive information and privileging affective information

**Dispositional Representations (DRs)**

- Reflect learned patterns of mentally managing cognitive and affective information
- More precise than Bowlby's internal working models due to emphasis on transient, in-process quality

**Impact of Experience on Attachment Strategies**

- Particular ways of processing experience lead to specific strategies for coping, eliciting caregiving, and reducing rejection or harm
- Repeated over time, these strategies create dispositional representations that reflect individuals' interpersonal expectations

**Expanded Classification System in DMM**

- Based on Ainsworth's distinction among avoidant (A), balanced or secure (B), and ambivalent (C) strategies
- Identifies strategies infants cannot yet organize, addressing organizations of thought and behavior beyond the range described by Ainsworth

**Foundation of Expanded System: Cognitive and Affective Information Processing**

- DMM is a two-category model with gradations between cognitive and affective processes
- Cognitive information: temporally ordered, basis for Type A organization
- Affect: based on intensity of stimulation, yields construct of "affect," basis of Type C organization
- Type B: balanced integration, psychological opposites, Types B and AC: their integration

### People using Type A strategies “tend to omit feelings from processing and to act in accordance with expected consequences” (Crittenden, 2005, p. 4). F

**Crittenden's Model of Attachment and Information-Processing Strategies**

- People use different strategies to process information for attachment: Type A, Type C, Type B, Types A/C, and Types AC (Crittenden, 2005, 2008; Crittenden & Landini, 2011)

**Type A Strategies:**
- Privilege cognitive information
- Form expectations based on perceived temporal contingencies
- Act according to expected consequences
- Reflect learned patterns for protecting and adapting in dangerous circumstances
- Can be classified as organized strategies (A, AC)

**Type C Strategies:**
- Privilege affective information
- Act according to feelings with little attention to consequences
- Result from disposition to process experience based on intensity and autonomic nervous system responses
- Reflect learned patterns for protecting and adapting in dangerous circumstances
- Can be classified as organized strategies (C, A/C)

**Type B Strategies:**
- Use a balanced, integrated way of processing both cognitive and affective information
- Depend on contextual demands

**Types A/C and AC:**
- Involve using both cognitive and affective strategies
- Types A/C: in alternating, less integrated ways
- Types AC: in blended ways that integrate false, denied, or delusional affect and cognition

**Application Across Developmental Spectrum:**
- Infancy: 11 possible patterns (3 variants of A and C)
- Preschool age: 13 patterns (reflecting maturing out of infancy patterns into new ones)
- School age: 15 patterns (6 C, 4 A)
- Adolescence: 17 patterns
- Adulthood: 22 patterns (8 variants of A and C, plus AC and A/C)

**Maturation Aspect:**
- Increases range of mental and behavioral responses with development
- Changes in self-protective organizations of thought and behavior
- Can result in new strategies or changes in pathways.

### Identification of States of Mind

**Identification of States of Mind and Attachment Types**

Mary Main's work with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) focuses on the coherence of a person's state of mind when describing early attachment relationships. Coherence is defined as a logical connection or consistency in thought, truthful, succinct, relevant, and clear.

**Secure adults:**
- Describe early attachment relationships in an organized and coherent manner.
- Richly and accurately describe memories with sufficient detail.
- Stay on topic.
- Depict a singular working model for each attachment figure.
- Score above 7 on the AAI coherence scale.

**Insecure adults:**

**Dismissing:**
- Do not describe early attachment relationships in a coherent manner.
- Rarely provide evidence or sufficient memory detail.
- Descriptions may be overidealized, unrealistic, succinct, or irrelevant.
- Score below 3 on the AAI coherence scale.

**Preoccupied:**
- Are excessively verbose.
- Descriptions are filled with irrelevancies, passive speech, and jargon.
- Descriptions are often long and meandering.
- Score below 3 on the AAI coherence scale.

**Disorganized:**
- Present a contradictory mixture of dismissing and preoccupied speech.
- Score below 3 on the AAI coherence scale.

The discovery that attachment patterns are represented by states of mind inferred through discourse patterns opened a new era in attachment research, allowing researchers to explore older children' and adults' representations of attachment.

### Three Generations of Metacognition

**Metacognition:** Thinking about thinking or direct perception of one's own or others' state of mind, including cognitive and affective experiences.

**Three Generations of Metacognition Research:**

**First Generation (John Flavell, 1986):** Defined metacognition as "thinking about thinking." Identified three types: appearance-reality distinction, representational diversity, and representational change.

**Second Generation (London School, Mary Main, 1991):**
- Metacognition in attachment research began with Mary Main using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).
- Secure adults have a greater capacity to reflect on their attachment experiences.
- Identified metacognitive thinking: appearance-reality distinction, representational diversity, and representational change.
- Developed Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) to measure reflective functioning across four domains.
- Highly developed reflective capacity is associated with secure AAI transcripts and coherence of mind.

**Third Generation (Rome School, Antonio Semerari, 2003):**
- Takes a modular view of metacognition, identifying four discrete categories: metacognitive identification, metacognitive mastery, metacognitive relating, and metacognitive integration.
- Differences in metacognition between diagnostic groups (borderline vs narcissistic personality disorders).
- Implication: Metacognitive deficits may be condition-specific, requiring metacognitive-based psychotherapy to address specific metacognitive deficits in patients with a specific diagnostic condition.

### Intersubjectivity

**Intersubjectivity and Attachment:**

* Ainsworth's research on maternal responsiveness and infant attachment:
  * Secure infants signal distress upon separation and relief in reunion episodes
  * Responsive mothers correctly identify signals and respond appropriately
  * Avoidant babies fail to communicate or mothers fail to recognize cues
  * Ambivalent babies show ongoing exaggerated distress, not relieved by mother's response
* Importance of interaction quality between mother and baby as a secure or insecure dyad
* Bowlby's concept of goal-corrected behavior emphasizes collaborative interaction and contingent reinforcement

**Winnicott's Contributions:**

* Mother's attuned presence acts as a "holding environment" for child
* Consistently encouraging and reassuring mother raises child with healthy sense of self
* Rejecting or discouraging mother raises child with fragile or false self
* Concept of holding conveys careful attunement by mother toward infant
* Winnicott's interest in play and its role in development of sense of self

**Experiments on Infant-Mother Interactions:**

* Tronick et al.'s still face experiment: reciprocal nature of infant-caregiver attunement, negative effects of misattunement
* Meltzoff's theory of innate intersubjectivity based on imitative behavior and perception of correspondence
* Trevarthen's theory of intersubjectivity as consequence of interactions between infant and mother over time
* Stern's emphasis on dyadic affect attunement and shift from mutually regulated behaviors to subjective states

**Relation Between Attachment and Intersubjectivity:**

* Attachment system: fosters felt security, exploration
* Intersubjective system: promotes experience of psychic intimacy and belonging
* Mutually enhancing but separate systems
* Well-synchronized mother-infant interactions predict secure attachment (Karen, 1998)

### Attunement, Misattunement, and Synchronization of Expression

**Attunement, Misattunement, and Synchronization of Expression**

Beatrice Beebe's research on intersubjectivity focuses on synchronized interactions between infants and mothers through nonverbal and verbal exchanges:

- Nonverbal dyadic exchanges: orientation, gaze, facial expression, touch, etc.
- Verbal dyadic exchanges: tone, pitch, vocal rhythm, turn-taking

**Misattunement**

Opposite of synchronized interactions:

- Insecure infants may experience misattunement in different ways:
  - Ambivalently attached infants: broadly misattuned to emotional expression but attentive during fear
  - Avoidantly attached infants: misattuned when expressing negative feelings or seeking comfort, attuned during exuberance

**Beebe's Research with Adult Patient–Therapist Dyads**

- Utilized questioning intonation and nonverbal communication to mirror patient's expressions
- Coordinated responses to model and enhance affect in disorganized patients
- Matching of communicative expressions regulates interpersonal contact and inner state
- Dolores gradually sensed a "comforted" inner state as she became more aware of Beebe's coordination
- Beebe used "motherese" to evoke new capacities for attachment-oriented communication in Dolores

**Importance of Attunement and Misattunement**

- Central concepts in understanding attachment disturbances in adults
- Forms the basis for treatment methods, including dyadic verbal communicative expressions like matching and coordination of tone, pitch, and vocal rhythm.

### CHAPTER 2 Understanding the Development of Attachment Bonds and Attachment Behavior Over the Life Course

**Chapter 2: Understanding the Development of Attachment Bonds and Attachment Behavior Over the Life Course**

- Developmentally informed treatments for attachment disturbances are based on understanding attachment bonds and their formation.
- An attachment bond, formed from an infant's internal maturation and interpersonal dynamics with primary caregiver, shapes development in self-experience, affect regulation, and capacity for intimacy.
- Secure or insecure attachment creates an internal representation (internal working model) that influences continued development.
- This chapter discusses the normative factors and dynamics contributing to secure attachment formation and related developmental achievements.

**Formation of a Secure Attachment Bond**

* **Initial Pre-Attachment:** Infant shows signs of readiness for attachment, such as smiling and following caregiver's gaze. Caregiver responds sensitively and consistently.
* **Attachment-in-the-Making:** Infant begins to show selective attachment to specific caregivers, crying when they leave and seeking them out when distressed. Caregiver provides consistent comfort and responsiveness.
* **Clear-Cut Attachment:** Infant develops a sense of security and trust in the caregiver, exploring environment with confidence. Caregiver is consistently available and sensitive to infant's needs.
* **Goal-Corrected Partnership:** Child begins to understand that attachment figure can be both a source of comfort and a guide for exploration. Caregiver provides guidance while allowing child autonomy.

**Changes in Attachment Bond Over the Life Course**

- Attachment bond is stably established by age 3 but continues to develop throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
- Changes include increased capacity for self-regulation, understanding of complex emotions, and formation of more complex relationships.

**Phases in Infants' Development and Strengthening of Attachment Bond (Ainsworth)**

* **Initial Pre-Attachment:** Infant shows readiness for attachment; caregiver responds sensitively.
* **Attachment-in-the-Making:** Infant begins to show selective attachment; caregiver provides consistent comfort and responsiveness.
* **Clear-Cut Attachment:** Infant develops sense of security and trust; caregiver is consistently available and sensitive.
* **Goal-Corrected Partnership:** Child understands attachment figure as both source of comfort and guide for exploration; caregiver provides guidance while allowing autonomy.

### Phase 1: The Pre-attachment Phase (Birth to 2–3 Months)

**Pre-attachment Phase (Birth to 2–3 Months)**

* Infants are entirely dependent on caregivers for survival and have innate responses to humans that promote proximity and caregiving.
* Automatic reflexive behaviors occur to attract caregiver's attention and provide information about needs.
* Earliest signs of nonverbal communication include tongue protrusion, smiling, and imitation.
* Infants have goal-corrected attachment behavioral system that enables flexible response to environmental changes while attempting to attain a goal (elimination of inner tension).
* Primary pre-attachment behaviors: crying, babbling, reaching, grasping, clinging, and smiling.
* Facial displays function as cues to caregiver and guide modification of environment for optimal development.
* Interactions between infant and caregiver create best-fit dyadic correspondence through adapting to each other's rhythms.
* Infant's nonverbal imitative capacity contributes to emerging relationship with caregiver through presymbolic communication.
* Several nervous system maturations support early attachment bond: clear visual preference for human face, head orientation toward others, and direct eye-to-eye contact.

**Infant Behaviors**

* Automatic reflexive behaviors to attract caregiver's attention and provide information about needs.
* Crying: alerting signal to caregiver to come and soothe infant.
* Reaching, grasping, clinging: physical expressions of desire for proximity and comfort.
* Smiling: earliest attachment behavior and automatic facial display pattern that ideally cues caregiver to maintain conditions eliciting smile.
* Facial displays of surprise, fear, frustration, anger, and contentment function as cues to caregiver and guide modification of environment for optimal development.

**Caregiver's Role**

* Responds to infant's signals and modifies environment to maximize conditions for infant's momentary wellbeing and perceptual development.
* Builds attunement to infant through reciprocal, contingent pattern of display-response-display.
* Motivated for presence and attention to infant due to preferred orientation and experience of learning contingencies that result in positive facial displays.

### Phase 2: Attachment-in-the-Making (2–3 to 6–9 Months)

**Phase 2: Attachment-in-Making (2-3 to 6-9 months)**

* Infant differentiates between familiar caregivers and others
* Signs of preferential orientation towards primary caregiver
* Reciprocal patterns of interaction with primary caregiver
* Ainsworth et al. (1978) referred to this phase as "orientation and signals directed toward one (or more) discriminated figure(s)"
* Marvin and Britner (2008): infant differentiates in directing attachment behavior

**Patterns of Behavior towards Primary Caregiver:**

* Visual-motor orientation
* Termination of crying
* Smiling
* Vocalization
* Greeting (with vocalization, smiling, reaching)
* Climbing and exploring
* Crying when caregiver leaves

**Contributing Factors:**

* Significant sensorimotor advances from three to six months
* Differentiation and recognition of primary caretakers
* New possibilities for dynamic interaction
* Infant's increasing control over behaviors
* Mutual exchange of facial displays between infant and caregiver

**Relational Capacities:**

* Initial intersubjective communication
* Protoconversational play (Trevarthen, 1998)
* Rudimentary "core self" and "emergent relatedness" (Stern, 1985)
* Emergence of self-awareness (Lewis & Brooks, 1978)
* Sufficient caregiver attunement promotes self-developments (D. P. Brown, 1993)

**Self-Developments:**

* Core self and emergent relatedness develop between second and sixth month
* Early sense of self emerges between fourth and eighth month
* Internal working models (IWMs) form based on linking and continuity of internal experience

**Notes:**

* Infant's nervous system not impaired and had good-enough caregiving shows signs of differentiating between familiar caregivers, especially the primary caregiver.
* Smiling is now a response to familiar caregivers.
* Reciprocal patterns of interaction increase preferential orientation towards the primary caregiver.
* Seven patterns of behavior emerge during Phase 2: visual-motor orientation, termination of crying, smiling, vocalization, greeting, climbing and exploring, and crying when caregiver leaves.
* Significant sensorimotor advances from three to six months contribute to differentiation and recognition of primary caretakers and new possibilities for dynamic interaction.
* Mutual exchange of facial displays between infant and caregiver emerges between four and six months.
* Initial intersubjective communication and protoconversational play occur during this phase.
* Rudimentary "core self" and emergent relatedness develop between second and sixth month, and early sense of self emerges between fourth and eighth month.
* Internal working models form based on linking and continuity of internal experience rather than recognition of caregivers as separate from that experience.
* Infant begins to seek and initiate interaction, develops greater control of behaviors, and is more able to make deliberate responses during the interaction.

### Phase 3: Clear-Cut Attachment (6–9 Months to 36 Months)

**Phase 3: Clear-Cut Attachment (6–36 Months)**

* Begins at around 6 months and culminates in a unique bond between the infant and primary caregiver (Ainsworth et al., 1978)
* Infants select one primary attachment figure, focusing on them when distressed or in need (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
* Consolidation of attachment bond and development of Internal Working Models (IWMs) shaping attachment patterns throughout life
* Attachment behavior becomes focused on the primary attachment figure
* Infant's maturational developments and caregiver's responses contribute to bond consolidation
* Between 12-18 months, attachment patterns become quite stable
* Major advance in attachment behavior with infant's acquisition of locomotion: crawling (7-11 months) and walking (second year)
	+ Infant able to maintain proximity through locomotion and explore environment
	+ New contact-seeking and contact-maintaining behaviors: preference for approaching, following, using as a secure base, and flight to the attachment figure
	+ Other behaviors: burying face in lap and clinging when frightened, ill, or distressed
* In a "good enough infant–caregiver system," mutual responsivity and reciprocal affective display strengthens bond and promotes developmental advances
* Caregiver's attunement and engagement enhance infant's experience of availability and responsiveness
* Infant eliciting behavior allows for cause-and-effect relationship recognition and initiative to elicit desired responses from the caregiver
* Imitative capacity expands, allowing for longer deferred imitation and expression of a wider range of affective possibilities
* Preconditions for expansion of infant's affect range and depth: greater organization and stability of autonomic nervous system (Izard et al., 1991; Lewis, 1971) and emerging cognitive developments.

### The infant’s greater awareness of internal affective states and the shifts among them, combined with the clear differentiation of attachment figures f

**Emergence of "Eighth Month Anxieties"**

- Around eight months, infants show facial and autonomic reactions to fear (Brown, 1993)
  - Fear responses to strangers, separations, novel objects, looming stimuli (Marks, 1987)
  - Increased wariness towards unfamiliar adults (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
- Development of person and object permanence (around eight months)
  - Infants respond to internal images and make comparisons (Bell, 1970; Piaget, 1981)

**Significant Integration and Differentiation Processes (9-12 months)**

- Object permanence allows infants to search for hidden objects or anticipate whole objects from parts (Piaget, 1981)
- Facilitated by attuned engagement and responsiveness from caregiver (Brown, 1993)
- Synchronization of affective expression and experience through empathic response (D. P. Brown, 1993)
- Cognitive development of ability to group and categorize (Inagaki, 1989)
  - Promotes differentiation among affective states and linkage to external expressions
  - Subsequent affective experience becomes more differentiated and categorized
  - Infant gets better at recognizing and categorizing affect states
  - Affective displays become less automatic and stereotyped, more autonomous and directly related to discrete states of experience.

### THE CAREGIVER’S ROLE IN PHASE 3 DEVELOPMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS

**Phase 3 Developmental Achievements and Caregiver's Role:**

**Normative Developments up to 12 Months:**

- By end of first year, infant in a good-enough system has capacity for wide range of affective experiences.
- Self-awareness refines and expands with categorical cognition forming "categorical self."
- Emergence of "subjective self" and discovery of other minds.
- Secure base behavior: infant leaves, returns to caregiver for comfort and reassurance.

**Factors Supporting Development:**

- Infant's maturational processes.
- Caregivers' ways of being with the infant.
- Interdependence of infant and caregiver behaviors.

**Caregiver Behavior and Attachment Bond:**

- Sensitive, responsive caregiving crucial for secure attachment bond.
- Maternal sensitivity: understanding child, accepting behavior, orchestrating harmonious interactions.

**General Factors Promoting Secure Attachment:**

- Physical presence.
- Consistency of beneficial caregiving factors and behaviors.
- Reliability of caregivers' availability and provision of care.
- Interest in infant and his/her individuality.

**Primary Behaviors Promoting Secure Attachment:**

1. Protection: physical safety.
2. Attunement: behavior, inner state, developmental capacities.
3. Soothing and reassurance: distress states.
4. Expressed delight: child's actions and unique being.
5. Unconditional support: exploration.

**Infant Experiences:**

- Felt sense of safety with caregiver.
- Comfort and security over time.

**Cognitive Developments:**

1. Capacity to categorize experience.
2. Representational cognition: symbolic representation of caregiver relationship internally.

**Formation of Internal Working Model:**

- Structuralization of relational experiences into foundation of attachment bond.
- Linking distinct affect states to particular caregivers.
- Development of internal map of attachment relationship.

### THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPRESENTATIONAL COGNITION

**Representational Cognition Development**

- Between 12-20 months, infants develop capacity for linking experiences to thought-based symbols (D. P. Brown, 1993)
  - Emergence of expressive language indicates presence of representational cognition
  - Shift from nonverbal gesturing and pointing to use of specific words as symbols
- Development of internal, symbolic representations of self and others
  - Rudimentary internal representations present earlier for differentiation of caregivers
  - Earlier representations based on presymbolic experiential and imitative memory impressions
  - Form simple image-based schemas
- During second year of life, these schemas become material for formation of internal symbolic representations
- Rapprochement subphase (about 15 months) marks development of separate internal representations of self and others (Mahler et al., 1975)
  - Normally-developed child establishes distinct and stable self and other representations by end of second year
- Internal representations of attachment relationships called "internal working models" or "attachment maps" (Bowlby, 1969/1982)

**Content of Infant's Object Representation of Primary Attachment Relationship**

- Central to representation are infant's experiences with attachment figure
- Good-enough infant–caregiver system: caregiver's protectiveness, attunement, soothing, delight, and support
- Infant's affective experience in response to caregiver behaviors
- Affective states become embedded in internal representations of self and other (Brown, 1993)
- Feelings about self and others linked to their internal images
- Quality of interactions fundamental components of attachment map

**Types of Attachment Maps**

- Secure attachment map: experiences and feelings of safety, comfort, soothing, availability, reliability, and stability
- Insecure attachment map: experiences of caregiver as unsafe, agitating, unreliable, unattuned, rejecting, and confusing

**Function of Internal Representations**

- Infant can have experiences and feelings about self, attachment figure, and relationship in response to internal representations
- Function as symbolic models setting up expectations about interactions.

### INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS, AFFECT TOLERANCE, AND AFFECT SELF-REGULATION

**Internal Representations, Affect Tolerance, and Affect Self-Regulation**

- Capacity for experiencing a range of emotions comes from maturational and relational dynamics during early Phase 3 period.
  - Stabilization of autonomic nervous system.
  - Intensification of infant–caregiver relationship and reciprocal affective displays.
  - Emergence of categorical cognition.

**Emotional Experiences vs. Affect Tolerance and Self-Regulation**

- Capacity to experience emotions is independent of ability to tolerate and regulate them.
- Affect tolerance and self-regulation depend on the ability to evoke representations of soothing.

**Soothing Representations**

- Internal representations provide soothing and support affect tolerance and self-regulation.
  - "Hallucinatory breast" (Schur, 1955) – internal representation of mother's breast and associated feelings of comfort and satiety.
  - Transitional objects (Winnicott, 1953) – symbolic representations of soothing experiences from caregivers.

**Internalization of Soothing Function**

- In a good enough child–caregiver system:
  - Child repeatedly experiences caregiver's soothing responses.
  - Maturation of representational capacity leads to internalization of soothing function.
- Heinz Kohut and Marian Tolpin call this process "transmuting internalization."
- Importance for affect self-regulation and structuralization of the self.

**Impact of Caregiver's Attunement and Soothing on Internal Representations**

- Consistent attunement and provision of soothing lead to strong and stable internal representations.
- Consistent failures in good-enough attunement and provision of soothing result in impaired affect experience, tolerance, self-regulation, and self-organization.
- Insecure attachment and adult personality disorders associated with problems in these domains.

### THE EMERGENCE OF PROTOTYPICAL ATTACHMENT PATTERNS

**The Emergence of Prototypical Attachment Patterns**

- The attachment bond develops gradually during the first year of life and can be secure or insecure.
- The period up until about 12 months is a sensitive period for attachment formation.
- Internal, symbolic mental representations of attachment relationships form around 12 months, creating relative stability of attachment prototypes.
- Attachment prototypes are internal working models or maps based on infant's experiences with caregivers.
- Ainsworth et al. (1978) identified four attachment prototypes: avoidant (A), secure (B), ambivalent/resistant (C), and disorganized/disoriented (D).
- Attachment prototypes are observable, consistent patterns of attachment behavior starting at around one year old.
- Secure attachment is stable from 12 to 18 months with about 62% of children maintaining the same classification.
- Caregiving skills and affective behavior contribute to attachment formation and maintenance.
- Mothers' emotional engagement and maturity influence attachment development.

**Sensitive Period for Attachment Formation**

- The first year of life is a sensitive period for attachment formation.
- Infants' readiness to become attached remains intact at least through the end of the first year.
- Later forming bonds tend to be more complicated and less adaptive than those formed during the first year.

**Internal Representation of Attachment Relationships**

- Around 12 months, infants begin to form internal representations of attachment relationships.
- These representations create relative stability of attachment prototypes.
- Modifications to attachment representations require changing existing ones rather than simple coalescing or cohering.

**Attachment Prototypes**

- Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) three attachment prototypes: avoidant, secure, and ambivalent/resistant.
- Mary Main and Judith Solomon added disorganized/disoriented attachment prototype.
- Attachment prototypes describe typical patterns of behavior with close others and underlying expectations about their behavior.
- Secure attachment is stable from 12 to 18 months, with about 62% of children maintaining the same classification.

**Factors Influencing Attachment Development**

- Caregiving skills contribute to attachment formation but are not the only factor.
- Affective behavior, such as maternal joy and pleasure, plays a role in maintaining adaptive relationships.
- Mothers' emotional engagement and maturity influence attachment development.
- Some children can change from insecure to secure attachment with improved caregiving and maternal maturation.

### Attachment Behavior During the Toddler Period (18 to 36 Months)

**Attachment Development during Toddler Period (18-36 Months)**

* Internal working model establishes prototypical attachment pattern around age 2, with minimal changes until three years.
* Visible behavioral changes due to developmental advances:
  * Increase in exploratory behavior.
  * Greater skill in monitoring caregiver's location and attentiveness.
  * Decreased physical contact need during reunion episodes.
  * Verbal expressions replace some physical proximity-seeking.
* Secure attachment:
  * Reduced distress during separation episodes.
  * Less crying, more verbal calling and active search.
* Developmental issues during toddler years:
  * Guided self-regulation: increasing self-regulation but continued dependence on caregiver for cues, feedback, and support.
  * Complex verbal communication development.
  * Secure child develops elaborate affective concepts and fantasies.
  * Cooperative behavior increases (e.g., altruistic actions).
* Three-year-olds:
  * Less distressed by brief separations.
  * Maintain exploratory behavior during reunion episodes.
  * Require less physical contact and proximity during reunions.
  * Developed locomotor skills allow for self-proximity maintenance under most conditions.

### Attachment Behavior During the Preschool Years (3 to 5 Years of Age)

**Attachment Development during Preschool Years (Ages 3-5)**

- Major developmental issue: Increasing self-regulation independent of caregiver
- Related issues: Greater self-agency with support, self-direction, self-management, and increasing peer competence

**Attachment Patterns and Peer Relationships**

- Secure (B) and ambivalent (C) three-and-a-half-year-olds have more positive peer relationships (Cassidy et al., 1996)
- Four-year-olds less disturbed by separation and maintain exploratory behavior in Strange Situation (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Ainsworth, 1990)

**Interaction of Developmental Processes and Attachment Patterns**

- Children begin to show capacity for coy behavior and false-positive affect during preschool years (Crittenden, 2008)
- Strategies for avoiding punishment, rejection, or aggression and eliciting nurturance
- Preschoolers not capable of intentional deception

**Preschool Attachment Patterns**

**(Based on Strange Situation Observations)**

- Secure/balanced (Crittenden, 1992a, 1992b)
- Defended
- Coercive
- Defended/coercive
- Anxious-depressed
- Insecure/other (Cassidy & Marvin, 1992)

**Preschool Profiles of Attachment Types**

- Avoidant (A): Hostile/mean, emotionally insulated, asocial, disconnected (Sroufe et al., 2005)
- Ambivalent/resistant (C): Anxious, overstimulated, passive-dependent (Sroufe et al., 2005)
- Disorganized (D): Controlling behaviors, defensive aggression toward peers, disruptive behaviors, anxiety about school performance, lower self-esteem (Solomon & George, 1999; Lyons-Ruth et al., 1993)

### Phase 4: Goal-Corrected Partnership

**Phase 4: Goal-Corrected Partnership**

According to Marvin and Britner (2008), during the third year of life, children begin to understand that others have their own feelings, goals, and plans. This leads to significant changes in the attachment system between ages 3 and 5.

- **Three-year-olds:** At this age, children may accept or protest separations but do not engage in setting up a shared plan for departure and reunion.
- **Four-year-olds:** Older preschoolers can comprehend multiple components of higher-order conceptualizations, including relationships, leading to goal-corrected partnership.
  * Capable of inferring mother's plans and goals
  * Coordinating them with their own
  * Understanding mother's perspective
  * Able to communicate effectively for mutual plans
  * Engaging in physical orientation, eye contact, nonverbal expressions, affect, and personal conversations

**Changes in Attachment Behavior:**

- Older preschoolers organize attachment behavior based on:
  * Physical orientation
  * Eye contact
  * Nonverbal expressions
  * Affect
  * Personal conversations
- Secure child's internal working model of the attachment relationship represents the attachment figure as available independent of proximity.

**Benefits:**

- Supports exploration of physical and interpersonal world
- Promotes self-development
- Increases comfort with interactions with nonfamiliar peers and adults

### Attachment Patterns in School Age Children (5 to 7 Years of Age)

**Attachment Patterns in School Age Children (5-7 Years)**

**Studies on Attachment Patterns in Six-Year-Olds:**

- Main and Cassidy (1988) modified Strange Situation for six-year-olds with a reunion paradigm.
- Three attachment groups (A, B, D) showed an 84% concordance rate over five years.
- Secure six-year-olds initiated conversations about separation and reunion.
- Avoidant six-year-olds looked briefly at caregivers, spoke minimally, and continued playing with toys.
- Disorganized/controlling six-year-olds assumed parental role, showed punitive or caretaking behaviors.

**Wartner et al. (1994) Study:**

- Used Main and Cassidy's reunion protocol for six-year-olds.
- Included children with A, B, C, or D classifications from earlier assessments.
- Found a comparable 82% concordance rate in attachment prototype classification over five years.
- Secure six-year-olds showed less physical proximity-seeking but greater verbal expression at reunion.
- Avoidant six-year-olds turned away from caregivers and showed little interaction or communication.
- Disorganized attachment had a 75% concordance rate from the first assessment to six years.

**Preschool Behavior of Secure, Insecure, and Disorganized Children:**

- Secure children initiated play, were more concentrated during play, friendly, had fewer conflicts, competent in conflict management, and fewer behavioral problems.
- Majority of secure children were found in the competent group.
- Disorganized children showed more odd and aggressive behaviors, engaged in power struggles, and manifested high levels of behavior problems.
- Disorganized attachment in early years becomes behavioral disorganization in later childhood (Teti et al., 1995).

### Attachment During Middle Childhood (7 to 12 Years of Age)

**Middle Childhood (7-12 Years)**

- Children experience more separations from parents due to school and activities
- Preference for peers as playmates (Kerns, 2008)
- Adaptation: less reliant on physical proximity, more on general availability of attachment figures during distress
- Self-protection function takes over
- Strong preference for parents in distress situations (Kerns, 2008)

**Attachment and Development**

- Secure middle childhood children show higher school and peer competence than insecure children (Sroufe et al., 2005)
- Insecure avoidant children: less contact-seeking
- Insecure anxious-resistant children: seek excessive guidance, reassurance
- Peer perception affected by parental attachment figure perception in early childhood (Cassidy et al., 1996)
- Representation of parents generalizes to peers (Cassidy et al., 1996)

**Internal Working Model of Attachment**

- Question if children develop integrated internal working model at this age
- Consistent experiences with different attachment figures may lead to a general, internally consistent representation (Kerns, 2008)
- Development may not occur until adolescence for children with very different experiences with different attachment figures.

### Attachment Patterns During Adolescence

**Attachment Patterns During Adolescence**

- Majority of adolescents retain early childhood attachment styles (Allen & Land, 1999)
- Emergence of a single overarching attachment organization predicts future behavior with offspring and marital partners.

**Characteristics of Adolescent Attachment Behavior:**

- Comparison of relationships with different attachment figures to one another and hypothetical ideals.
- Increased sophistication in managing goal-corrected partnerships with parents.
- Gradual increase in independence, but still seeking parental support during extreme stress.
- Negotiation rather than coordination characterizes the goal-corrected partnership between adolescent and parents (Allen, 2008).

**Role of Peer Relationships:**

- Interactions with peers provide sources of intimacy, feedback, and attachment relationships.
- Dependencies are transferred from parental to peer relationships by midadolescence.

**Romantic Intimate Attachments:**

- Characterized by proximity-seeking, secure base, safe haven, and separation protest (Allen & Land, 1999).
- Certain long-term relationships serve the same functions as early childhood attachment relationships for adolescents with secure attachment.

**Insecure Attachment in Adolescence:**

**Dismissing Attachment:**

- Least autonomy and relatedness in interactions with parents (Allen & Hauser, 1996).
- Disengagement from parental attachment figures may interfere with normal development.
- Associated with externalizing symptoms (Becker-Stoll & Fremmer-Bombik, 1997).
- Lower ego-resilience, greater hostility, and less family support (Kobak & Sceery, 1988).

**Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment:**

- Greater autonomy-inhibiting behaviors than other groups.
- Enmeshed with parents throughout adolescence (Allen & Hauser, 1996).
- Persistence of involving anger from conflicts with fathers and inability to withdraw from these conflicts (Allen & Hauser, 1996).
- Less ego-resilient, more anxious, higher levels of distress, and greater need for family support (Kobak & Sceery, 1988).

**Secure Attachment:**

- More ego-resilient, less anxious, and less hostile with peers than insecure adolescents.

### Attachment in Adult Intimate Relationships

**Attachment in Adult Intimate Relationships**

- Certain romantic relationships exhibit attachment behaviors and functions (Hazen & Zeifman, 1999):
  * Proximity-seeking: closeness for physical comfort and soothing, sexual attraction
  * Secure base: emotional support and safety
  * Safe haven: emotional refuge in times of distress
  * Separation distress: anxiety when apart from partner

**Differences between Childhood and Adult Attachment**

- Childhood attachments are one-sided, while adult romantic attachment is mutual
- Goal-corrected partnership: each partner regulates attachment for each other

**Stages of Romantic Relationship Development** (Hazen & Zeifman, 1999)

1. Pre-attachment: initial interest and attraction
2. Attachment-in-the-making (falling in love): intense emotional connection
3. Clear-cut attachment (loving): commitment and deep emotional bond
4. Mutual goal-corrected partnership: mutual regulation of attachment
5. Emotional interdependence: deep emotional connection and intertwined lives

**Internal Working Models of Adult Attachment**

- More complex than childhood prototypes
- Include elements of early attachment prototypes and core conflictual relationship themes
- Affected by adult romantic experiences (Kobak, 1998)

**Adult Romantic Internal Working Models**

- Diverse and flexible for secure adults
- Less diverse and inflexible for insecure adults with significant attachment disturbance

**Hierarchy of Adult Relational Models** (Feeney, 2008; Collins & Read, 1994)

- Generalized models at the top of hierarchy
- Intermediate level: models for particular classes of relationships (family, peers)
- Lowest level: models for specific relationships (father, spouse)

**Secure vs. Insecure Adults' Internal Relational Maps**

- Secure adults have complex and flexible internal relational maps
- Insecure adults with significant attachment disturbance show less flexibility and updating, manifesting similar strategies across most adult relationships

### PART II ASSESSMENT CHAPTER 3 Adult Attachment Prototypes and Their Clinical Manifestations

**Part II Assessment**

**Chapter 3: Adult Attachment Prototypes and Their Clinical Manifestations**

- Understanding adult attachment patterns is crucial for effective treatment of attachment disturbances.
- This chapter outlines the main features of secure and insecure adult attachment prototypes, including etiological factors, behavioral characteristics, and assessment responses.

**Securely Attached Adults**

- Secure attachment develops from consistent maternal responsiveness and contingent matching.
- Secure adults report positive and strong bonds with parents and family members.
- Secure individuals find a balance between attachment and autonomy.
- Secure adults value attachment, are comfortable discussing attachment themes, have coherent discourse, and show metacognitive monitoring.
- Secure adults are comfortable with their limitations and can forgive and compassionately reflect on past experiences.
- Secure adults in romantic relationships seek emotional support, provide support to partners, and have stable, satisfying relationships.
- Secure adults have a coherent, positive sense of self and are more ego-resilient.
- In therapy, secure patients form strong working alliances, perceive therapists as emotionally responsive, and explore issues in greater depth.

**Insecure Attachment Prototypes (to be covered in Chapter 4)**

- Anxious attachment: fear of abandonment and rejection, intense preoccupation with relationship security, and hypervigilance to signs of threat.
- Avoidant attachment: reluctance to form close relationships due to fear of being engulfed or smothered by others.
- Disorganized attachment: unpredictable and contradictory behaviors in response to attachment needs, often resulting from complex trauma histories.

**Secure Adults' Characteristics (Summary)**

- Values attachment
- Comfortable with attachment themes
- Coherent discourse
- Metacognitive monitoring
- Strong personal identity
- Comfortable with limitations and imperfections
- Seeks emotional support in relationships
- Provides emotional support to partners
- Stable, satisfying relationships
- Coherent, positive sense of self
- More ego-resilient
- Forms strong working alliances in therapy
- Perceives therapist as emotionally responsive
- Explores therapeutic issues in greater depth.

### Dismissing Insecure Adults

**Attachment:** a complex psychological system that develops in infancy and shapes interpersonal relationships throughout the lifespan.

**Avoidant Attachment:** results from consistent and repetitive rejection of attachment behaviors by the primary attachment figure.

**Dismissing Adults:** individuals with avoidant attachment style as adults, characterized by a deactivated attachment system.

**Causes of Dismissing Attachment:**

* Consistent rejection of attachment behaviors by caregiver
* Child learns to suppress attachment behavior to receive minimal care
* Parents of infants who later become dismissing tend to:
  * Terminate infant's cries less often

- Eager to be with partner all the time
- Needs excessive reassurance
- Clinging, demanding, nagging, sulking
- Desire to merge
- Attempts to win favor or impress
- Self-centeredness, showing off, center of attention

**Disorganized/Fearful Attachment:**
- Disorganized Internal World (dysregulated psychophysiological state, affect dysregulation, lapses in self-observation or monitoring, discontinuous self-states and affect states, cognitive distortion, confusion, drive-dominated thinking)
- Impaired self-agency and goal-directed behavior
- Inhibition of exploration and play
- Disorganized Attachment Behavior (activation of contradictory attachment strategies, controlling behaviors, submissive or excessive caretaking behaviors, "stable instability" in relationships, defensive aggression and helplessness, inability to elicit desired responses)

**Deactivation of the Attachment System:**
- Alternative behavior chains and systems developed to manage distressing affect
- Dismissing adults function with a deactivated attachment system
- Rely on nonattachment-related systems for coping and adaptation
- Unlikely to seek social support

### From self-report studies of adult romantic attachments, it is well established that in relationships, dismissing adults engage primarily in deactivati

**Adult Dismissing Attachment:**

**Characteristics:**

- Explore others' problems in therapy rather than their own (Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991)
- Intellectualize disclosures and rarely explore own issues and dynamics (Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991)

**Goals in Relationships:**

1. Gaining whatever they need while maintaining distance, control, and self-reliance
2. Ignoring or denying needs and avoiding negative emotional states that might trigger attachment-system activation

**Strategies:**

- Denial of attachment needs
- Compulsive self-reliance
- Dismissal of threats and need for attachment figure availability
- Deactivating strategies involve inhibition of primary attachment strategy (proximity seeking)

**Manifestations:**

(See Table 3.1 in the text for a more comprehensive list)

### With respect to access to attachment-related memories and emotions, anxious-preoccupied adults remain preoccupied with past hurts. They tend to rumina

**Anxious-Preoccupied Adults:**

* Preoccupied with past hurts and negative emotions
* Ruminate about the past, engage in emotion-focused coping
* Strong emotional reactivity and pervasively negative moods
* Increased vulnerability to depressive symptoms due to need for reassurances
* Maladaptive perfectionism and ineffective coping mediate depression
* Low self-confidence and weak sense of self
* Less differentiated self-structure with high accessibility of negative self-attributes
* Over-evaluate perception of self-other similarity
* Merge with therapist to reduce fear of being unloved
* Extensively focus on therapist and other patients
* Weaker working alliance than secure patients
* Intense anxiety in psychotherapy interferes with progress
* Hyperactivating strategies: overdependence, excessive demands, enmeshment/merger, minimizing distance, clinging and controlling behavior

**Manifestations of Anxious-Preoccupied Insecure Attachment:** (Refer to Table 3.1 for a more comprehensive list)

* Fear of abandonment or rejection
* Intense jealousy
* Persistent need for reassurance and validation
* Overanalyzing relationships
* Interpreting ambiguous situations negatively

### Disorganized/Fearful Insecure Adults

**Disorganized/Fearful Attachment**

- Outcome of frightening and frightened parental behavior and unresolved trauma or loss in a parent (Main & Hesse, 1990, 1992)
- Parent is present but not present to the child, leading to repetitive unresponsiveness
- More likely to report one or more parents with drinking problems or physical/sexual abuse
- Manifest contradictory deactivating and hyperactivating attachment styles in different circumstances or simultaneously
- Strong propensity to dissociate in face of attachment-related threats
- Low coherence of discourse/mind, indicating multiple, contradictory attachment patterns with no dominant style
- Combinations of dismissing and preoccupied patterns common, leading to "cannot classify" (CC) classification
- Unresolved/disorganized (Ud) status with respect to loss or trauma also common

**Characteristics of Disorganized/Fearful Adults**

* Low self-confidence and balance of control in relationships
* Negative correlations with self-confidence, coherence, self-disclosure, intimacy, involvement, reliance on others, use of others as a secure base, and balance of control for friends and romantic relationships
* Passive, unassertive, or socially inhibited in relationships (Horowitz et al., 1993; Lopez, 2009)
* Persistent themes of interpersonal distrust, vulnerability, passive withdrawal, fragmented self-states, and dissociative qualities (Lopez, 2009)
* Chronic low self-esteem (Lopez, 2009)
* Confusing vacillation among detached, dependent, and controlling postures in close relationships (Reis & Grenyer, 2004)
* Greater level of interpersonal conflict than other insecure or secure adults (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991)
* Preoccupation with past hurts and inaccessibility of past memories and emotions of early attachment relationships (Horowitz et al., 1993)
* High levels of dissociative behaviors and symptoms (Main & Hesse, 1992; Searle & Meara, 1999)
* Diminished emotional expressiveness compared to other insecure or secure adults (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991)
* Poorly developed and fragmented self (Lopez, 2009)

**Therapeutic Considerations for Disorganized/Fearful Adults**

- Fears of rejection and withdrawal negatively correlated with session exploration (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
- Avoidant attachment to therapist associated with shallow, rough sessions and reluctance to self-disclose (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
- Less improvement following psychotherapy due to negative view of self and others (Reis & Grenyer, 2004)
- Difficulty making a positive, timely response to treatment and longer stabilization in treatment than other patients (Cyranowski et al., 2002)

**Manifestations of Adult Disorganized/Fearful Attachment** (Table 3.1)

- Balance between healthy attachment behavior and healthy exploratory behavior: Securely attached adults
- Deactivation of attachment behavior and strong independent pseudo-self: Dismissing adults
- Hyperactivation of attachment behavior and inhibition of exploratory behavior: Anxious-preoccupied adults
- Contradictory mixture of both deactivating and hyperactivating attachment styles and strongly inhibited exploratory behavior: Disorganized, fearful adults

### CHAPTER 4 The Assessment of Adult Attachment

**Chapter 4: Assessment of Adult Attachment**

* Mary Ainsworth's pioneering work on childhood attachment assessment with the Strange Situation procedure (Ainsworth et al., 1978)
* Solomon and George (2008) review various methods for assessing and classifying attachment in children, focusing on adult attachment patterns
* Two main types of assessment: interview-based and self-report-based
* Interview-based methods provide richer detail but demand more resources

**Interview-Based Assessment**

* Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and Scoring System
  * Elicits patterns of language indicative of attachment states of mind through descriptions of childhood experiences
  * Highly related to infants' Strange Situation attachment behavior (75% correspondence, kappa = 0.61)
  * Five primary AAI classifications: Secure, Dismissing, Preoccupied, Unresolved/Disorganized, and Cannot Classify
    * Secure matches Strange Situation secure
    * Dismissing matches avoidant
    * Preoccupied matches resistant or ambivalent
    * Unresolved/Disorganized may overlap with disorganized/disoriented
    * Cannot Classify has no established correspondent in Strange Situation
  * An AAI classification reflects a set of rules for organizing attachment-related information (Main et al., 1985)
  * Each attachment type represents unique rules or strategies for regulating emotion and attention during attachment experiences (Wallin, 2007)
* AAI activates internal working model, creating language patterns to identify attachment organization or internal working model (Hesse, 2008)

**Table 4.1: Comparison of Classifications from the AAI and Strange Situation**

| AAI Adult Verbal Behavior | Corresponding Infant Strange Situation Behavior |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Secure                   | Secure                                       |
| Dismissing               | Avoidant                                     |
| Preoccupied              | Resistant or Ambivalent                      |
| Unresolved/Disorganized  | Disorganized/Disoriented                     |
| Cannot Classify          | N/A                                         |

### Adult State of Mind With Respect to Attachment Infant Strange Situation Behavior Secure/autonomous (F) Secure (B) Coherent, collaborative discourse. V

**Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

- Assesses adult attachment status through language by examining how attachment experiences are described during a semi-structured interview
- Central task for participants: producing and reflecting on memories related to attachment while maintaining coherent, collaborative discourse with the interviewer
- Historical accuracy of described attachment experiences not important
- Assesses in-the-present state of mind with respect to attachment, revealing operative internal working model

**Attachment Categories**

*Secure (B)*
  - Coherent, collaborative discourse
  - Values attachment but explores room and toys during pre-separation episodes
  - Shows signs of missing parent during separation and evaluation is consistent
  - Preference for parent over stranger
  - Greets parent actively and initiates physical contact
  - Displays some contact-maintaining behavior after reunion

*Secure/autonomous (F)*
  - Coherent, collaborative discourse
  - Explores room and toys during pre-separation episodes with objective perspective
  - Shows signs of missing parent during separation and evaluation is consistent
  - Preference for parent over stranger
  - Greets parent actively and initiates physical contact
  - Displays some contact-maintaining behavior after reunion

*Dismissing (D)*
  - Not coherent
  - Fails to cry on separation from parent
  - Actively avoids and ignores relationship
  - Normalizing response to parent on reunion
  - Little or no proximity-seeking or contact-seeking
  - Unemotional response to parent
  - Transcripts tend to be excessively brief, violating Grice's maxims of quantity

*Avoidant (A)*
  - Similar to Dismissing but with more anger and passive behavior

*Preoccupied (E)*
  - Not coherent
  - Preoccupied by past attachment relationships
  - May be wary or distressed prior to separation
  - Focuses on parent throughout procedure
  - Sentences are often long, grammatically entangled, or filled with vague usages
  - Fails to settle and take comfort in parent on reunion
  - Transcripts are often excessively long, violating Grice's maxim of quantity

*Unresolved/disorganized (Ud)*
  - Disorganized and/or disoriented behaviors during discussions of loss or abuse
  - Lapses in monitoring of reasoning or discourse
  - May indicate belief that a dead person is still alive or that this person was killed by someone
  - Individual will ordinarily fit the D, E, or F category.

**Importance of AAI**

- Provides reliable and valid assessment of adult attachment status through language
- Reveals operative internal working model that applies to all attachment-related experiences.

### Administration of the AAI

**Administration of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

- Obtains information through a semi-structured interview
- 20 primary questions with follow-up probes
- Takes 45-75 minutes, audio-recorded for transcription
- Requires supervised training by a qualified trainer

**Interview Overview**

1. Family background question: Establishes rapport and gathers basic information
2. Early childhood relationship with each parent: Describes relationship using adjectives
3. Handling emotional upset, illness, injury, and separations
4. Emotionally charged experiences (rejection, abuse, loss)
5. Influence of early childhood experiences on adult personality
6. Current relationships with parents
7. Learning from childhood experiences
8. Attachment relationship with own children or imagined relationship

**Sample Questions**

1. Help me get oriented to your family...
3-4. Describe your relationship with mother/father using five adjectives...
8. Did you ever feel rejected as a child?...
13. Have you experienced the loss of a parent or loved one?...
15. What is your current relationship with your parents like?

Note: This summary does not qualify readers to administer the AAI without proper training.

### AAI Analysis and Coding

**AAI Analysis and Coding**

- Verbatim transcript of interview is analyzed and coded using Main et al.'s Adult Attachment Scoring and Classification System (2002)

**Experience Scales**

- Five types: Loving, Rejecting, Involving, Neglecting, Pressure to Achieve
- Scores do not determine attachment status but reflect parental behaviors associated with specific attachments
- High Loving scores = secure attachment
- High Rejecting scores = dismissing attachment
- High Involving scores = preoccupied attachment

**State-of-Mind Scales**

- Assess current state of mind of interviewee regarding attachment
- Most important scales: Coherence of Discourse and Coherence of Mind
- High coherence associated with secure attachment and mental health, low coherence with insecure attachment and relationship disturbance/psychopathology

**Coherence**

- Defined as overall consistency, clarity, and sensitivity to questions and context
- Consideration of Grice's maxims, speech quality, quantity, relevance, and manner

**Speech Quality**

- Apparent truthfulness and consistency with evidence
- Clear examples from memory to back up adjectives given about parents

**Quantity**

- Appropriate amount of speech in response to each question
- Dismissing attachment: too little speech, brief responses
- Preoccupied attachment: too much speech, long responses

**Relevance**

- Consistent response to question or prompt
- Stay on topic

**Manner**

- Clear and specific language
- Avoid vague jargon, contentless words, incomplete sentences

**Secure Interviewees**

- Consistently describe attachment experiences accurately with sufficient evidence
- Adequate but not excessive detail
- Clear and fresh descriptions with little jargon
- Collaborative with interviewer
- Show Metacognitive Monitoring: awareness of approach to interview, logical contradictions, personal biases, reaction tendencies, fallibility of memory.

### The Idealization state-of-mind scale is particularly relevant to the determination of dismissing attachment status. Idealization pertains to the speak

**Idealization State-of-Mind Scale:**

- Relevant to determination of dismissing attachment status
- Speaker attempts to fabricate excellent parenting or unrealistically happy childhood
- Evidence insufficient or contradictory to unrealistically positive view
- Dismissing interviewees show high idealization
- May present vague, nonspecific memories or indicate lack of memory

**Derogation Scale:**

- Relevant to dismissing attachment
- Speaker directly dismisses or minimizes attachment experiences
- Passages may include back-and-forth canned exchanges with parents

**Involving Anger Scale:**

- Relevant to preoccupied attachment
- Speaker indicates and speaks excessively about past/present anger towards attachment figure
- Characterized by run-on sentences, poor ability to focus anger, excessive detail about offenses

**Passivity Scale:**

- Relevant to preoccupied attachment
- Frequent vague, incomplete, odd or irrelevant passages
- Confusions in voice, oscillating between perspectives

**Attachment Interview (AAI):**

- Explores important losses and traumatic experiences in childhood
- Ratings made on scales to assess temporary disorganization of state of mind

**Loss:**

- Significant failures of monitoring of reasoning, such as speaking as though deceased is still alive
- Unusual attention to detail about death or funeral, prolonged silence, incomplete exploration, invasion of loss into other parts of interview

**Trauma or Abuse:**

- Denial of abuse, thinking self caused it, believing abuser still has influence, blocking topic from consciousness
- Unfinished exploration, odd associations, intrusive images while describing trauma or abuse

**Temporary Disorganization of State of Mind:**

- Occurs when interviewee is exploring trauma or loss experience
- Temporary alterations in consciousness or working memory
- Given weight in overall rating of unresolved/disorganized (Ud) state of mind with respect to loss or trauma.

### AAI Attachment Classifications

**AAI Attachment Classifications**

- Scores on state-of-mind scales determine main AAI attachment type
- Three main types: Secure (F), Dismissing (Ds), and Preoccupied (E)

**Secure (F)**

- Corresponds to secure/autonomous (B) in Strange Situation (SS)
- High coherence of discourse
- Explores attachment themes with fresh speech
- Values attachment
- Shows metacognitive monitoring
- Thoughtful, reflective, and forgiving of parental limitations

**Dismissing (Ds)**

- Corresponds to avoidant (A) in SS
- Downplays influence of attachment relationships
- Presents strong, normal, independent sense of self
- Idealizes parents
- Minimizes negative experiences and emotions
- Poor quality and quantity of speech

**Preoccupied (E)**

- Corresponds to resistant/ambivalent (C) in SS
- Excessively lengthy descriptions of attachment experiences
- Filled with psychological jargon and canned speech
- Lacks freshness

**Unresolved/Disorganized (Ud)**

- With respect to loss or trauma/abuse
- Corresponds to disorganized/disoriented (D) in SS

**Advantages of AAI Scoring Approach**

- Honors continuous nature of attachment patterns
- Allows for subclassifications within each main classification

**Subclassifications**

- Secure: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5
  * F1 and F2: Secure with some degree of dismissing or preoccupied attachment
  * F3: Prototype of secure attachment (high coherence)
  * F4 and F5: Secure with some degree of preoccupation (varies in nature)
- Dismissing: Ds1, Ds2, Ds3
  * Ds1: More severely dismissing
  * Ds2: Derogatory dismissing
  * Ds3: Less severe dismissing with signs of valuing attachment
- Preoccupied: E1, E2, E3
  * E1: High passivity
  * E2: Angry preoccupation
  * E3: Fearful preoccupation

### Dismissing Secure Preoccupied

**Attachment Classification: Cannot Classify (CC)**

* The AAI manual uses the CC category for interviewees who show no single predominant attachment type (Main et al., 2002)
* No established corresponding Strange Situation behavior pattern (p. 7)
* Our opinion: CC is a form of disorganization, associated with the D category from SS
* Main difference between Ud and CC: pervasiveness of disorganization, not disorganization itself
* CC transcripts may show contradictory strategies or lack of coherence
* Hesse (2008) identified two types of CC:
  * Contradictory strategies CC: mixture of dismissing and anxious-preoccupied strategies
  * Low coherence CC: pervasive disorganization and low coherence
* Developers of the manual have not extensively used AAI in clinical populations, preventing full subtyping of CC
* Our research identifies nine different CC subtypes:
  1. Dismissing strategy for one parent, preoccupied for another (Ds vs E)
  2. Oscillation between contradictory strategies for the same parent
  3. Patients with dissociative identity disorder or borderline patients showing oscillating attachment strategies
  4. Individuals with multiple caregivers: contradictory strategies depending on caregiver
  5. Interviewees switching strategies during interview
  6. Transcripts characterized by pervasive fear and low coherence
  7. Refusal or inability to cooperate, providing insufficient information
  8. Lack of any attachment strategy whatsoever
  9. Extreme incoherence throughout the interview
* CC classification is frequently found in patients with personality and/or dissociative disorders
* Our research supports that CC, or pervasive disorganization throughout an AAI transcript, is characteristic of these patient populations
* The five-way classification system is necessary for assessing attachment state of mind in patients with severe psychopathology.

### Incorporating the AAI Into Clinical Practice

**Incorporating the Attachment Interview (AAI) into Clinical Practice**

* Recommended tool for assessing attachment in adults in clinical populations
* Assesses state of mind with respect to attachment, important for detecting and understanding internal working models
* Provides comprehensive information about a patient's attachment style
* Requires considerable time investment for training:
  **Two-week intensive class:**
    - Learn all experience and state-of-mind scales
    - Determine main attachment strategy and subclassifications
  **Practice period:**
    - Score 30 practice transcripts with feedback
    - Score 36 more transcripts over three years
  **Certification:**
    - Achieve inter-judge agreement of 80% or higher with certified trainers
* High training standards maintain reliability and validity (inter-judge agreement: 82%)
* Some clinicians hesitate due to time commitment
* Alternative option:
  * Administer the AAI
  * Have transcripts scored by a certified scorer for a fee
  * Receive detailed report on scoring results

**Advantages of Using the AAI:**

* Provides extensive information about a patient's attachment state of mind
* Helps clinicians think deeply about attachment in their patients

**Disadvantages of Using the AAI:**

* Requires significant time investment for training
* Limited availability and enrollment in training courses

**Alternative Approach to Using the AAI:**

* Administer the interview
* Have transcripts scored by a certified scorer
* Receive detailed report on scoring results
* More accessible than full training for clinicians with time constraints

### THE AAI Q-SORT SCORING SYSTEM

**AAI Q-Sort Scoring System**

- Alternative method to score Attachment Anxiety Inventory (AAI) using Q-sort methodology (Kobak, 1989/1993; Waters & Deane, 1985)
- Replaces 9-point Likert experience and state-of-mind scales with a list of 100 items called the "Q-set"
- Items describe different aspects of interview transcripts, including information processing, emotion regulation, and working models of self and parents
- Items are printed on cards and sorted into nine piles based on their characteristic level for each interviewee:
  - Piles 9, 8, and 7: most characteristic items
  - Piles 3, 2, and 1: most uncharacteristic items
  - Center piles: neither characteristic nor uncharacteristic items
- Q-sort descriptions can be scored at the level of individual items and constructs (e.g., security, dependency, sociability)
- Items associated with specific attachment prototypes (secure, dismissing, preoccupied)
  - Secure attachment: "Comfortable with interview," "Relaxed relationship"
  - Dismissing attachment: "Provided minimum responses," "Not preoccupied with negative effects"
  - Preoccupied attachment: "Fears of loss or abandonment," "Mother or father was not psychologically available"
- Analyzing sorted Q-sets allows for classification along two continuous dimensions related to attachment organization: security/insecurity and deactivating/hyperactiving
- Continuous assessment has advantages in statistical evaluations, recognizing overlap among attachment patterns
- Derive three-category differentiation of primary attachment strategy (secure, dismissing, preoccupied) from Q-sort data with an 80% overlap between AAI and Q-sort classifications
- Traditional AAI scoring approach using ratings on the AAI scales is more practical for most clinicians.

### THE DYNAMIC-MATURATIONAL MODEL (DMM) METHODS OF ASSESSMENT

**Dynamic-Maturation Model (DMM) of Attachment and Adaptation**

- Developed by Patricia Crittenden and Andrea Landini (2011) as a comprehensive system for assessing attachment status
- Based on discourse analysis of responses to interview questions, expanding on traditional AAI methods
- Wider range of information elicited, including anger, dangerous experiences, adolescence, adult attachment, sexuality, and parenting
- Includes many more subcategories in the DMM discourse coding system
- Addresses patterns beyond the range described by Ainsworth
- Expands on Main and Goldwyn's classificatory procedures without conflict
- Integral to understanding attachment behavior and underlying dynamics
- Developed from a broader sampling of AAIs, including clinical populations
- 22 possible classifications of adult discourse patterns, 12 unresolved loss forms, 14 unresolved trauma forms
- Rejects D and CC classifications, identifies coping strategies instead

**DMM Assessment System**

- Based on Crittenden's structured interview, the DMM-AAI
- Expands on AAI with additional questions
- Includes eliciting information about anger, dangerous experiences, adolescence, adult attachment, sexuality, and parenting
- Wider range of information allows for greater differentiation among individuals with psychological disorders

**DMM Discourse Coding System**

- Many more subcategories than traditional A, B, C, D
- Addresses patterns beyond the range described by Ainsworth
- Expands on Main and Goldwyn's classificatory procedures without conflict

**Crittenden's Perspective**

- Believes state-of-the-art methods for assessing adult attachment do not address integral dimensions of attachment behavior
- Offers DMM methods as an expansion and updating of traditional methods
- Particularly beneficial for clinical populations

**Development of the DMM System**

- Based on AAIs from various demographics, including nonclinical, outpatient treatment, psychiatric hospitals, and prisoners
- Broader sampling yielded a larger set of coding classifications
- 22 possible classifications of adult discourse patterns, 12 unresolved loss forms, 14 unresolved trauma forms

**Rejection of D and CC Classifications**

- Crittenden does not find value in these classifications
- Believes they indicate a lack of recognition for organized coping strategies developed to cope with experiences with attachment figures
- Identifies particular combinations of discourse patterns instead

### The DMM-AAI

**The DMM-AAI (Crittenden, 2007)**

- Modification of Attachment and Adolescent Interview (AAI) by Crittenden
- Maintains overall sequence and importance of careful administration
- Includes more questions to elicit information from various memory systems and salient adult issues
- Unpublished, available to qualified researchers and clinicians

**DMM Classification Methods (Crittenden & Landini, 2011)**

- Evaluates coherence of discourse and identifies patterns related to parental rejection, neglect, role reversal, pressure to achieve, and involvement
- Uses complex pattern recognition for classification
- Includes indication of primary information processing strategy, differentiation of strategies with attachment figures, unresolved trauma or loss, and modifiers

**DMM Classification of Attachment Strategies**

- Emphasizes two primary information-processing strategies: cognitive (omitting affect) and affective (omitting cognition)
- Five B categories reflecting varying degrees of both forms of information
- Balanced (B) speakers use both sources of information effectively
  - B3: widest range of mental, behavioral, and discourse strategies
  - B1 and B2: cognitive emphasis
  - B4 and B5: affective emphasis
- Odd-numbered strategies focus on attachment figures, even-numbered on self-experience
- Tendencies within each strategy: idealization (B1, odd-numbered A) vs. negation of self (B2, even-numbered A), fear and desire for comfort (B4, even-numbered C) vs. angry affect expression (B5, odd-numbered C)

### Adults using Type A strategies present positive, idealized descriptions of their parents in response to questions from the AAI. In response to the fiv

**Type A Strategies:**

- Adults using Type A strategies present idealized descriptions of parents in response to questions from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).
- Words used are often similar positive qualities, synonyms, and accompanied by absolute enhancers.
- Reflects defensive splitting between good and bad parental attributes in semantic memory.
- Difficulty recalling examples from experience that illustrate descriptive words given due to privileging cognitive, temporal information over affect.
- Tend to make semantic generalizations framed as if/then statements.
- Dismiss their own perspectives, feelings, and needs.
- Behave as if following the rule: Do the right thing—from other people's perspective without regard to one's own feelings and desires.
- Adults using Type A strategies tend to demonstrate moderate to low coherence.
- Speak in an orderly manner but present insufficient quantity of speech about negative aspects of attachment figure and positive aspects of self.
- Show poor quality of speech with little evidence for positive statements.
- Relevance of speech is compromised by describing childhood experience from others' points of view.

**Type A Strategies (dismissing attachment in the context of physical safety):**

- A1 and A2 strategies result when children do not receive comfort they seek or experience overt rejection of attachment behavior but are physically safe.
- Involves mild distortion of positive and negative characteristics of parental behavior.
- Correspond to Ainsworth's A1 and Main et al.'s Ds1, and A2 corresponds to Ainsworth's A2 and Main et al.'s Ds3.

**Type A Strategies (dismissing in the context of danger):**

- A3 to A8 strategies reflect more severe and chronic childhood experience of danger.
- Result when parents are the source of danger or fail to protect children from danger and if the danger is predictable and preventable.
- High-numbered A strategies result from more severe childhood experiences of danger.
- Speakers' interpretations of problematic experience with parents tend to take two primary forms: exonerating or justifying parents’ actions or nonactions, and negating or denying oneself and one's attachment needs and feelings.
- Across the A1 to A8 spectrum, forms of affect omission and coping response change and become more severe, associated with more severe psychopathology.

**Type C Strategies:**

- Based on affect—feeling states and levels of arousal.
- Use affect to organize psychological processes and self-protective behavior.
- Display nonverbal indicators of high arousal and images of scary, irritating, or comforting contexts.
- Confused about causation due to unpredictable temporal order and contingencies during childhood.
- Three primary affect states that motivate behavior are anger, fear, and desire for comfort.
- Manage conflicting affect states by "splitting" and displaying one part in an exaggerated manner while inhibiting competing feelings.
- Odd-numbered strategies indicate a speaker's AAI discourse tends toward gradations of angry affect and its expression, whereas even-numbered strategies reflect the relative prevalence of fear and desire for comfort.

### In contrast with the Type A patterns, in which speakers tend to dismiss their own perspectives, feeling states, and needs, the Type C patterns all inc

**Type C Patterns in Attachment:**

* In contrast to Type A patterns, where speakers dismiss their own perspectives, Type C patterns involve preoccupation with the self and dismissing others in relationships.
* Focus on own feelings, wants, and needs leads to coercive strategies for eliciting comfort and protection from attachment figures.
* Characterized by:
  * Privileging affective information over temporal and causal aspects of cognitive processing
  * Blurring boundaries of person, place, and time in discourse
  * Use of vague, imprecise language and image-based descriptions
  * Low to very low coherence in speech

**Discourse Characteristics:**

* Involving discourse: rushing through past experiences with intense words
* Expecting interviewers to supply needed words and thoughts
* Attempting psychological collusion against others or suspecting collusion
* Difficulty with temporal and causal understanding leading to deficits in semantic memory and expression

**Type C Patterns and Infant Categories:**

* Ainsworth's Type C infant pattern: ambivalent, alternating anger, fear, and desire for comfort
* Crittenden's C1 and C2 patterns: preoccupied with relationships due to unpredictable care
  * Similar to Main and Goldwyn's E2 and E1 patterns but with added discourse characteristics

**High-Numbered Type C Patterns (C3-C8):**

* Obsessive strategies, consumed by a single perspective
* Angry invulnerability in odd-numbered strategies
* Desire for comfort and fear in even-numbered strategies
* No manifestation of fear and desire for comfort in C3, C5, and C7 patterns
* Speakers present with a pugnacious veneer to hide vulnerability and desire for comfort.

### The even-numbered strategies, which privilege vulnerable affect and expression and inhibit and exclude anger, also exist along a continuum of gradatio

**Crittenden's Attachment Classification System**

**Strategies privileging vulnerability and expression (C strategies):**

* Gradation from almost complete desire for comfort to near exclusion of anger and fear (B4) to substantial fear mixed with equal desire for comfort (C4), etc.
* Type C speakers engage in distortions of information:
  * Passive semantic thought (C1 and C2)
  * Reductionist blaming thought (C3 and C4)
  * Rationalization of self (C5 and C6)
  * Denied self-responsibility or delusional states (C7 and C8)
* A/C and AC strategies combine A and C strategies, providing more clarity and specificity than the disorganized (D) or cannot classify (CC) categories in Main and Solomon's model.

**Alternating (A/C) strategies:**

* Use any combination from both low-and high-numbered patterns.
* Reflect use of specific strategies for different attachment figures or situations.

**AC blended strategy:**

* Greater integration of affect-privileging and cognition-privileging information-processing patterns than A/C strategies.
* Involves some degree of omission and/or distortion of information.
* AC gradient of increasing omission and distortion: A1-2C1-2 to A3-6C3-6 to A7-8C7-8.

**Unclassifiable transcripts (IO):**

* Some transcripts may not fit any B, A, C, or combination patterns.
* Crittenden recommends setting aside for periodic reconsideration and identifying organization as it is identified.

**Modifiers:**

* Depressed: speaker aware strategies not resolving problems and self irrelevant to outcomes.
* Disoriented: significant verbal inconsistencies, discrepancies, and disruptions in speakers using combination patterns.
* Intrusions of forbidden negative affect: sudden change from inhibited state to high arousal with unacceptable language or forms of address.
* Expressed somatic symptoms: nonverbal behaviors disrupting communication during AAI.
* Reorganizing: speakers changing strategies, neither functioning fully.

**Unresolved trauma and loss:**

* Crittenden has brought more differentiation and specificity to the unresolved (U) category.
* Primary differentiation is between dismissed and preoccupying forms of unresolved trauma and loss.
* George et al.'s AAI better at eliciting evidence for preoccupying lack of resolution, while DMM-AAI obtains information that can more clearly identify both forms and their subtypes.

### Incorporating the DMM Into Clinical Practice

**DMM (Dynamic-Maturational Model) vs. Traditional AAI in Clinical Practice**

* Some clinicians consider DMM a valuable alternative or supplement to traditional AAI due to finer differentiation of attachment strategies and adaptive patterns.
* Greater complexity of DMM requires shift from prototypes to specific adaptive strategies, extensive training for proficiency, and regular practice for reliability.
* DMM offers more clinically rich descriptive categories but is less well-known and used than AAI.
* Wider acceptance awaits further academic research and testing.
* AAI approach is more established with extensive literature and robust across cultures.
* Traditional AAI has been used to assess a wide range of clinical populations, and continued research will lead to deeper understanding.

**Contributions of DMM System**

* Greater number of classifications that finely differentiate attachment strategies.
* Focus on specific adaptive patterns in attachment contexts.

**Challenges with DMM Assessment and Classification Method**

* Complexity reflects a finer-grained understanding but makes interrater reliability more challenging.
* Extensive training is necessary for proficiency and reliability.
* Supervised coding of at least 100 transcripts required for initial reliability.
* Regular practice, periodic recertification, and avoiding conditions that decrease reliability are essential.

**Comparison between DMM and Traditional AAI**

* Simplicity vs. complexity: AAI has four prototypical primary attachment patterns with unresolved classification, while DMM offers a wide variety of clinically rich descriptive categories.
* Training requirements: AAI requires less extensive training compared to DMM.
* Acceptance and research: The traditional AAI approach is more established with a larger body of knowledge.
* Unique aspects and strengths: Both models have unique aspects, and the field benefits from seeing and respecting them.

**Treatment Approaches**

* No major new ideas or recommendations for differential treatment approaches have come from the traditional AAI model in over two decades.
* Crittenden and Landini propose a Three Pillars treatment approach derived from the original AAI and its classification system to fulfill this need.

### THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP INTERVIEW (CRI)

**Current Relationship Interview (CRI)**

* Assesses current state of mind with respect to attachment in adult romantic partnerships
* Modeled after Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) but explores reciprocal nature of adult relationships
* Intended to assess adult attachment within close relationships and how it integrates into existing representation or develops
* May reveal characteristics of several attachment classifications due to influences from past family experiences, previous romantic relationships, and current partner's behavior

**Assessment Process:**

1. Thorough history of family relationships: quality of parental marriage, lovingness, conflict exposure, etc.
2. Previous romantic relationships: beginning, intensity, ending
3. Current romantic relationship: exploration in depth, adjectives used to describe it, degree of satisfaction, experience and current-state-of-mind scales

**Experience Scales:**

* Loving score: assesses loving behavior, supportiveness, availability, responsiveness (lowers with physical/verbal aggression)
* Rejecting behavior: attempts to decrease attachment behavior
* Involving behavior: attempts to heighten attachment behavior
* Controlling behavior: inhibiting exploratory behavior and undermining feelings of support and assurance
* Dependency: interviewee's life revolves around partner, immature/childlike behavior, giving in or trying to please partner excessively
* Communication: quantity and quality of communication between partners

**Relationship Assessment:**

* Safe Haven: assesses caregiving and care-seeking for both partners during stressful times
* Coherence of discourse and state of mind with respect to attachment to the current romantic partner

**Classification System:**

* Secure, dismissing, preoccupied, unresolved/disorganized
* Secure: S1 (secure with dismissing elements), S2 (prototype of secure attachment), S3 (secure with preoccupied elements)
* Dismissing: D1-D4 (more to less extremely insecure)
* Preoccupied: P1 (passive), P2 (angry), P3 (enmeshed), P4 (controlling)

**CRI vs. AAI:**

* CRI is considered a better tool for evaluating state of mind in current romantic relationships due to differences between attachment relationships in childhood and adulthood
* Meta-analysis of AAI classifications found low concordance rate for attachment status of each partner in a couple, suggesting factors other than attachment security are active in partner selection and maintenance
* Little relation between broad construct of marital satisfaction and AAI classification but feelings of intimacy are related.

### THE ADULT ATTACHMENT PROJECTIVE PICTURE SYSTEM (AAP)

**The Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP)**

- Measures attachment coherence: representational integration of attachment and caregiving
- Assessment based on evaluation of narrative structure and content of responses to a set of images
- Visual projective tool designed to elicit attachment-related themes
- Consists of eight cards: Neutral, Child at Window, Departure, Bench, Bed, Ambulance, Cemetery, Child in Corner
- Participant asked to describe picture and imagine what led up to it and what will happen next
- Analysis focuses on overall patterns of story content and defensive processing elements
- Classification based on degree and form of attachment-related defenses: secure, dismissing, preoccupied, unresolved

**Attachment Coherence and Defensive Processing**

- Both secure and insecure attachments associated with defense
- Secure individuals: defense acts as a sorting mechanism, transforming and excluding attachment affect experience to support integration, flexibility, and sincere confidence
- Insecure individuals: defense takes on an exclusionary role, akin to original thinking of Bowlby

**Attachment Categories in AAP Classification System**

- Secure: presence of internalized secure base and haven of safety in alone stories, sensitivity or goal-corrected synchrony in dyadic stories
- Dismissing: deactivation predominates in story responses, excluding thoughts and affects that would activate attachment systems
- Preoccupied: cognitive disconnection without deactivation, non-integrated attachment information, inclusion of irrelevant information and affect, uncertainty leaving individual unsettled
- Unresolved: evidence of segregated systems (dysregulation or constricted immobilization) due to intense, unresolved experience becoming inaccessible to consciousness

**Determining Attachment Status with AAP**

- Strong association with AAI classifications: kappa for convergent validity 0.89 (two-way classification), 0.84 (four-way classification)
- Limitations: significant time investment for scoring competence, no information about attachment prototype subclassifications, limited research on use in clinical populations
- Value as a measure of major attachment prototypes

### Self-Report Based Assessment PEER AND PARENTAL ATTACHMENT IN ADOLESCENCE

**Self-Report Based Assessment of Peer and Parental Attachment in Adolescence**

* Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987) is a widely used self-report inventory to assess adolescent attachment.
* Evaluates parental and peer attachment in three categories: mutual trust, communication quality, and anger/alienation.
* Example items for each category:
  * Mutual Trust (Parent): "My parents respect my feelings."
  * Communication Quality (Peer): "My friends listen to what I have to say."
  * Anger/Alienation (Parent): "My mother expects too much of me."
* Peer items examples:
  * Mutual Trust (Peer): "I trust my friends."
  * Communication Quality (Peer): "My friends like to get my point of view on things I am concerned about."
  * Anger/Alienation (Peer): "Talking over my problems with my friends makes me feel ashamed or foolish."
* Positive correlation between quality of parent and peer attachments in adolescents and self-esteem, life satisfaction, and wellbeing.

**Prototype Approach – Romantic Attachment**

* Hazen and Shaver (1987, 1990) developed a forced-choice self-report assessment for adult romantic relationships based on Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) three attachment patterns: secure/autonomous, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent.
* Single-item measure of attachment styles with the advantages of brevity, face validity, and ease of administration.
* Instructions for respondents: choose the prototype that best describes their way of thinking, behaving, and feeling in romantic relationships.
* Prototypical descriptions:
  * Secure: "I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me."
  * Avoidant: "I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them."
  * Anxious/Ambivalent: "I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't want to stay with me."
* Initial distribution of respondents: 56% secure, 19% anxious/ambivalent, and 25% avoidant.

**Categorical and Dimensional Measures of Adult Romantic Relationships**

* Limitations of the forced-choice prototype approach: not possible to have more than one attachment classification, and it does not allow for the detection of multiple internal working models of attachment.
* Developing continuous rating scales to examine adult attachment styles in more detail.
* Adult Attachment Scale (AAS) by Collins and Read (1990):
  * Consists of 18 questionnaire items rated on a Likert scale format.
  * Example questions: "I am comfortable depending on others," "I often worry that my partner does not really love me," "I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others."
  * Factor analysis revealed three factors: closeness, dependency, and anxiety.
* Collins and Read's factor analysis shows that self-report questionnaires of adult romantic attachment need to address a wider variance of attachment style than can be depicted by single-item or few-item assessments.

### Attachment Style (AS)

**Attachment Style (AS)**

- Criticisms of Hazen and Shaver's single item assessment tool:
  - Simpson (1990): Meaningful individual difference variability within each category cannot be assessed.
  - Some adults may exhibit a blend of two or more styles.
- Simpson's response: Decomposed the prototype item and created a 13-item assessment tool.

**Assessment Tool:**

- Items rated on a 7-point Likert scale.
- Sample items: "I find it relatively easy to get close to others," "I am nervous whenever anyone gets close to me," "I often worry that my partner(s) don't really love me." (p. 973)

**Findings:**

- Secure attachment style:
  - Characterized by higher levels of interdependence, trust, commitment, and satisfaction in relationships.
  - Positive emotional experience within relationships.
- Insecure attachment styles:
  - Anxious and avoidant styles have relationships defined by the opposite set of features.
  - Anxious style: Negative emotional experience within relationships.
  - Avoidant style: Less negative emotion but less positive emotion in relationships. (p. 977)

### The Adult Style Questionnaire (ASQ) Feeney and Noller (1990) and Feeney, Noller, and Hanrahan (1994) decomposed the Hazen and Shaver prototype item in

**The Adult Style Questionnaire (ASQ)**

- Developed by Feeney and Noller (1990) and Feeney, Noller, and Hanrahan (1994)
- Based on Hazen and Shaver prototype item
- Decomposed into 65 items
- Principal component analysis reduced items to a 40-item scale
- Intended for young adolescents with little romantic relationship experience

**Factor Analysis Results**

- Three-factor solution: Secure, Anxious, and Avoidant
- Five-factor solution:
  - Previously Anxiety factors: Need for Approval and Preoccupation with Relationships
  - Previously Avoidance factors: Discomfort with Closeness and Relationships as Secondary
  - New factor: Confidence

**Conclusion**

- Distinct types of insecurely attached individuals can be identified, especially among young adults with limited romantic relationship experience. (Feeney, Noller, & Hanrahan, 1994)

### The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) Brennan, Shaver, and Tobey (1991) found that fearful subjects tended to endorse both the avoidant and ambivalent H

**The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ)**

- Developed by Brennan, Shaver, and Tobey (1991) as an alternative to Hazen and Shaver's prototype measure
- Four prototypes: secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful

**Prototype Descriptions**

*Secure:*
  - Easy to become emotionally close to others
  - Comfortable depending on others and having them depend on you
  - No worry about being alone or unaccepted

*Dismissing:*
  - Comfortable without close emotional relationships
  - Value independence and self-sufficiency
  - Prefer not to depend on or have others depend on you

*Preoccupied:*
  - Want complete emotional intimacy with others
  - Uncomfortable being without close relationships
  - Sometimes worry that others don't value them as much

*Fearful:*
  - Somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others
  - Want emotionally close relationships but find it difficult to trust
  - Worry about being hurt if they allow themselves to become too close

**Prototype Classification**

- Two dimensions: self versus other and positive versus negative
- Secure: Positive self and positive other
- Preoccupied: Positive other and negative self
- Dismissing: Positive self and negative other
- Fearful: Negative self and negative other

**Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991)**

- Divided Hazen and Shaver's avoidant category into fearfully avoidant and dismissing avoidant categories
- RQ dismissing category differs from Hazen and Shaver's avoidant description

**Individual Variability**

- Most subjects reported a mix of tendencies across time and relationships
- A great deal of individual variability was lost when the four continuous ratings were collapsed into a simple, four-category classification

**Factor Analysis**

- Brennan, Clark, and Shaver (1998) conducted a factor analysis of 60 attachment subscales across existing measures
- Found a two-factor solution: avoidance of intimacy and anxiety about romantic involvement
- Simpson and Rholes (1998) concluded that these two dimensions underlie virtually all self-report adult romantic attachment measures

### The Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ) Just as further research on Hazen and Shaver’s self-report prototype item led to greater refinement of the

**The Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ)**

- Developed from attempts to refine and identify underlying structure of Hazen and Shaver's Relationship Quotient (RQ)
- Griffin and Bartholomew (1994) created RSQ for yielding attachment subscales

**Components of RSQ**

- Based on items from: Love Quiz, Relationship Questionnaire, Adult Attachment Scale
- 5-point scale: not at all like me to very much like me

**Attachment Subscales and Examples**

*Secure Attachment*
- "I find it relatively easy to get close to others"

*Avoidant Attachment*
- "I am nervous when anyone gets too close to me"

*Ambivalent Attachment*
- "I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like"

*Fearful Attachment*
- "I worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others"

**Results of RSQ**

- Failed to clearly identify attachment categories (Fraley & Waller, 1998)

### Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) Obegi and Berant (2009) state, “By the mid-to late 1990s, researchers and clinicians new to the field were dr

**Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR)**

* By the late 1990s, researchers were overwhelmed by self-report measures of adult romantic attachment.
* Factor analyses revealed a two-dimensional typology: anxiety and avoidance.
* Adult romantic attachment moved from three categories to scaling people on these dimensions.

**Attachment-related Anxiety:**

* Insecurity about partner's availability, love, and responsiveness.
* Examples of items: "I am afraid I will lose my partner's love," "I worry that my partner doesn't really know me."

**Attachment-related Avoidance:**

* Strategies for regulating attachment behavior, thought, and affect.
* Examples of items: "I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down," "I find myself becoming closed off when under stress with my partner."

**Experience in Close Relationships Scale (ECR) and Experience of Close Relationships–Revised version (ECR-R):**

* Based on empirically derived items from various self-report measures.
* 18 anxious attachment items, 18 avoidant attachment items.
* Scaled using a 7-point Likert scale.
* Widely recognized as one of the best and most empirically sound self-report instruments for assessing adult romantic attachment.

**Interview vs. Self-Report Assessment:**

* Weak correlations between AAI interview and self-report measures of adult romantic attachment.
* AAI evaluates state of mind, self-report measures obtain conscious reporting.
* Adult romantic involvement entails a wider range of relational behaviors than AAI scales.
* Healthy adults have greater range and flexibility of attachment behaviors.
* Recommendation: use AAI and related measures in clinical populations, ECR-R for healthy individuals with the goal of creating greater range and flexibility.

**Key Points:**

* Two dimensions of adult romantic attachment: anxiety and avoidance.
* ECR and ECR-R are recommended self-report instruments for assessing adult romantic attachment.
* Weak correlations between AAI interview and self-report measures.
* Use AAI in clinical populations, ECR-R for healthy individuals with the goal of creating greater range and flexibility.

### Assessment of Attachment-Related Behaviors in Treatment A number of assessment scales are especially useful to the attachment-based therapist as a way

**Attachment-Related Behaviors in Treatment**

* Assessment scales help attachment-based therapists evaluate working alliance, attachment to therapist, and internal working model development in patients

**Working Alliance Inventory (WAI)**

* Developed by Horvath and Greenberg (1989) to assess three areas of the working alliance: bonds, goals, and tasks
* Consists of 36 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale
* Securely attached patients had higher working alliance than preoccupied or avoidant patients (Lyons-Ruth et al., 2007)
* Can be used throughout treatment to assess progress

**Client Attachment to Therapist Scale (CATS)**

* Directly measures patient attachment bond to therapist
* Developed by Mallinckrodt, Gantt, & Coble (1995), Woodhouse et al. (2003)
* Three-factor solution: Secure, Avoidant-Fearful, and Preoccupied-Merger
* Items rated on a 6-point Likert scale
* Detects hyperactivating and deactivating behaviors in treatment
* More securely attached individuals better tolerate negative transference (Woodhouse et al., 2003)
* Mallinckrodt & Jeong (2015) found:
  * CATS security negatively correlated with anxiety and avoidance
  * CATS avoidance positively correlated with anxiety and avoidance
  * CATS preoccupation positively correlated with anxiety but not avoidance
* CATS captured variance not accounted for by the WAI (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
* Clients with strong avoidance and anxiety in romantic relationships also showed strong avoidance and anxiety in therapeutic attachments (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
* Security associated with greater depth and smoothness of exploration in treatment (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)

### THE THERAPIST REPRESENTATIONAL INVENTORY (TRI) The Therapist Representation Inventory (Geller, Behrends, Hartley, Farber, & Rohde, 1992; Geller & Farb

**Therapist Representation Inventory (TRI)**

- Assesses development of internal working models of attachment to therapist as secure base (Geller et al., 1992; Geller & Farber, 1993)
- Consists of 50 items rated on a 9-point Likert scale
- Two subscales: Therapist Embodiment Scale (TES) and Therapist Involvement Scale (TIS)

**Therapist Embodiment Scale (TES)**

- Consists of 12 items
- Taps imagistic, enactive, and conversational aspects of therapist representation
- Imagistic: "I imagine my therapist sitting in his/her office"
- Enactive: "I am aware of a particular emotional atmosphere which gives me the sense that my therapist is with me"
- Conversational: "I think of my therapist making specific statements to me"

**Therapist Involvement Scale (TIS)**

- Consists of 38 items
- Measures salience of discrete affective-interpersonal themes in patients' involvement with mental representations of their therapists
- Taps various dimensions: physical, extratherapeutic, continuing therapeutic work, doubting efficacy, strengthening contact, and missing the therapist
- Includes 24 items assessing emotions associated with therapist representation (comfort, relief, discouragement, anger, anxiety)

**Key Findings**

- Patients develop more available visual or imagistic representation of attachment-based therapist as treatment progresses (Rosenzweig et al., 1996)
- Clients in longer-term therapy use conversational mode to represent their therapists more frequently than those in shorter-term therapy (Geller & Farber, 1993)

### CHAPTER 5 Attachment and Psychopathology An Overview of Attachment and Psychopathology

**Chapter 5: Attachment and Psychopathology**

**Overview of Attachment and Psychopathology**
- Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) explore the relationship between attachment and psychopathology.
- Attachment problems may cause psychopathology, but it's unclear which types and why some individuals develop certain symptoms over others.

**Limitations of Understanding Psychopathology and Attachment**
- Ein-Dor and Doron (2015) discuss the challenges in explaining how attachment insecurities lead to various disorders and why one individual may develop specific symptoms while another does not.

**Classification of Psychological Disorders**
- Disorders are categorized as either internalizing or externalizing:
  * Internalizing: Anxiety disorders, PTSD, depression (characterized by fear, distress, or depression)
  * Externalizing: Substance abuse, impulsivity, aggression (outwardly observable phenomena)

**Attachment Problems as Distal Risk Factors for Psychopathology**
- Attachment problems, whether anxious or avoidant, are considered distal risk factors for psychopathology.

**Dark Triad of Processes Linking Attachment Anxiety with Multiple Disorders**
- Three proximal risk factors in attachment anxiety:
  * Maladaptive emotion-regulation processes (up-regulate negative affectivity)
  * Greater vigilance to threat-related cues and heightened empathic accuracy
  * Lower level of perceived others’ responsiveness

**Dark Triad of Processes Linking Attachment Avoidance with Multiple Disorders**
- Three proximal risk factors in attachment avoidance:
  * Maladaptive emotion-regulation processes (down-regulate affectivity, employ distancing strategies)
  * Compulsive self-reliance
  * Lower levels of social support and perceived others’ responsiveness

**Moderators Fomenting Psychopathology**
- Four moderators that interact with the above proximal risk factors to cause psychopathology:
  * Chronic environment with a moderate level of threat
  * Significant loss
  * Traumatic experiences
  * Modeling, observational learning, and reinforcement increasing conduct problems

**Mikulincer and Shaver's Questions Regarding Attachment-Psychopathology Connection**
- Three important questions Mikulincer and Shaver tried to answer:
  1. Can a specific type of attachment insecurity reliably link to a specific type of psychopathology?
  2. Is attachment pathology solely and directly responsible for psychopathology?
  3. In what direction (unidirectional or bidirectional) are attachment and psychopathology linked?

**Conclusions on Attachment-Psychopathology Connection**
- Beyond certain disorders like separation anxiety and pathological grief, attachment insecurities alone are unlikely to be the sole cause of mental disorders.
- Other factors such as genetics, intelligence, and life history play a role in the development of psychopathology.

### In our view, serious mental disorders result from multiple converging processes, and attachment insecurities act as catalysts of other pathogenic proc

**Serious Mental Disorders and Attachment Insecurities**

- Serious mental disorders result from multiple converging processes
- Attachment insecurities act as catalysts for other pathogenic processes, reducing psychological and social resources, and weakening resilience
- Attachment insecurities can contribute to psychological disorders, but mental afflictions can also exacerbate attachment insecurity and lead to more severe attachment-system dysfunctions

**Self-Report vs. Interview Assessment of Attachment**

**Self-Report Measures:**

- First measure of adult romantic attachment by Hazen and Shaver (1987)
- Reveals little about unconscious influences contributing to attachment patterns
- Categorical and forced-choice nature, does not acknowledge individual differences within a category
- Limited test/retest stability (70%) due to measurement error, not true changes in attachment security over time

**Internalized Working Models:**

- Internalized set of assumptions regarding self and self-in-relation-to-others
- Self-report measures subject to response bias and represent conscious perception, not underlying representations

**Interview-Based Assessment (Adult Attachment Interview - AAI):**

- Accesses adult's unconscious processes pertaining to emotional regulation
- Identifies specific attachment style by coding forms of narrative interaction with prompts
- Surprising the unconscious, providing a more detailed subclassification of attachment style
- Particularly important for complex cases and treatment planning
- Gold standard of measurement in therapeutic approach

**Comparison between AAI and Self-Report Measures:**

- Little overlap between AAI and self-report measures (e.g., Adult Attachment Scale, Experiences in Close Relationships scale)
- Differences in what and how the interview and self-report instruments measure
- Meta-analysis by Roisman et al. (2007) found trivial to small overlap between AAI attachment status and self-reported attachment style

**Chapter Overview:**

This chapter explores the empirical associations between disturbed attachment classification and risk for certain types of psychopathology. It reviews findings from both self-report and interview-based assessment methods, providing integrative commentary on the connection between attachment status and specific forms of psychopathology.

### ATTACHMENT, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND PSYCHIATRIC DISTRESS

**Attachment, Emotional Distress, and Psychiatric Distress**

Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) reviewed studies on the correlation between attachment styles and neuroticism or negative affectivity:

**Correlation between Attachment Anxiety and Neuroticism:**
- Approximately 30 studies in nonclinical populations were examined.
- All studies found significant correlations between attachment anxiety and neuroticism.
- Previously learned attachment strategies continue to influence individuals' emotional experiences.

**Correlation between Attachment Orientation and Psychiatric Symptoms/Negative Affectivity:**

**Study Design:**
- Review of 61 studies.
- Measures: IPPA (Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment), PAQ (Parental Attachment Questionnaire), Adult Attachment Scale, SCID interviews, Brief Symptom Inventory, and Symptom Checklist–90.

**Findings:**
- Secure attachment to parents associated with lower levels of negative affectivity and less severe psychiatric symptomatology.
- Anxious form of attachment insecurity significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms/negative affectivity.
- Fewer studies found correlations between avoidant style and psychiatric symptoms/negative affectivity.

### ATTACHMENT AND ANXIETY DISORDERS In their review of the research looking at attachment and anxiety disorders, Ein-Dor and Doron (2015) noted that anxi

**Attachment and Anxiety Disorders**

* Ein-Dor and Doron (2015) found that:
  * Anxious and preoccupied attachment styles correlate with more significant symptoms of anxiety.
  * The association between avoidant attachment style and anxiety is less clear, with approximately only 50% of studies finding a significant association.
* Doron et al. (2009) investigated the relationship between insecure attachment and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):
  * Insecure attachment, as measured by the Experience in Close Relationships - Revised (ECR), is related to elevated levels of OCD-related thinking style and symptoms.
  * Attachment anxiety has a stronger relationship than attachment avoidance.
* Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) found that:
  * Secure attachment experiences reduce fear responses in spider phobics.
  * Insecure attachment experiences increase fear responses in spider phobics.
  * Anxious attachment is correlated with spider phobia and phobic avoidance.
* Dozier et al. (2008) suggest that:
  * Internalizing disorders, including anxiety-related disorders, are associated with the expression of attachment needs.
* Bowlby's hypothesis suggests that:
  * Anxiety disorders are related to the proximity and availability of the primary attachment figure.
  * The infant-caregiver attachment relationship is the foundation of personality development.
* Research supports the following findings:
  * Secure attachment is related to the development of emotion regulation and supports the balance between safety, curiosity, and exploration.
  * Insecure attachment in infancy is associated with anxiety symptoms in adolescence due to insecure internal working models of relationships.
* E. K. Adam et al. (2004) found that:
  * Mothers' observed parenting behaviors and self-reports of emotional wellbeing correlate with adult attachment classifications using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).
  * Preoccupied mothers reported significantly higher levels of negative affect and anxiety and demonstrated angry and intrusive parenting behaviors.

### In their study of mothers with anxiety disorders, Manassis, Bradley, Goldberg, Hood, and Swinson (1994) administered the AAI (using the four-way class

**Study by Manassis et al. (1994): Anxious Mothers and Their Insecurely Attached Children**

- Conducted AAI using the four-way classification system on 18 outpatient women with anxiety disorders.
- Majority had primary diagnosis of panic disorder (78%).
- 78% of mothers were unresolved (Ud) with respect to trauma or loss:
  - Six were Ud with respect to loss.
  - Two were Ud with respect to trauma.
  - Six were Ud with respect to both.
- 85% of children were insecurely attached, and 65% were disorganized.
- High level of insecure attachment in children led to the importance of addressing potential issues in parent-child relationships.
- Helping anxious adults resolve past experiences may indirectly benefit their children.

**Study by Fonagy et al. (1996): Anxiety Disorders and Unresolved Attachment Classification (Ud)**

- Conducted AAI on 82 nonpsychotic inpatients and 85 controls using the Main and Goldwyn four-way classification system.
- Significantly more inpatients (76%) received an unresolved classification (Ud) than controls.
- Correlation between Ud and anxiety disorder diagnosis.
- Anxiety may be related to past experiences invading the present, but causality is unclear.

**Study by Ivarsson et al. (2008): Attachment Classifications among Adolescents with OCD**

- Interviewed 100 adolescents: 25 each with OCD, depressive disorder (DD), and both OCD and DD, and general population controls.
- AAI used to assess attachment classification using the five-way classification system.
- Classification differed significantly across groups:
  - Adolescents with OCD showed a prevalence of dismissing traits (60%).
  - 40% of DD group was unresolved (Ud) or cannot classify (CC).
  - Subjects with both OCD and DD were classified as dismissing or unresolved.
- Attachment disturbances could contribute to OCD development and reinforce symptoms over time.

**Panic Disorders and Attachment Classifications**

- Little research on correlation between attachment classifications and panic disorders.
- Zeijlmans van Emmichoven et al. (2003) studied 28 outpatients with panic disorder with agoraphobia using the AAI four-way attachment classification system.
- Majority had dismissing attachment: 43% were dismissing (Ds), 29% were preoccupied (E), and 11% were unresolved (Ud).

**Proposed Solution: Ideal Parent Figure Protocol**

- Proposed method for reshaping internal working models by creating new, fresh, and positive attachment representations.
- Detailed description in Chapter 8 of the book.

### Attachment and Affective Disorders AFFECTIVE DISORDERS AND SUICIDALITY

**Attachment and Affective Disorders**

**Affective Disorders and Suicidality**

- Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) reviewed studies on attachment quality in adulthood and depressive symptoms:
  - Secure attachment linked to lower levels of depression.
  - Anxious attachment (preoccupied or elevated anxiety) associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression.
  - Avoidant attachment (dismissing or avoidance) linked to about 50% having higher levels of anxiety and depression.
- **Studies on Attachment Dispositions and Depressive Symptoms** (Ein-Dor & Doron, 2015):
  - Over 100 studies examined links between attachment dispositions and depressive symptoms.
  - Dismissing or preoccupied classification on the AAI and self-reported attachment avoidance or anxiety associated with more depressive symptoms.

**Longitudinal Study: Mothers' Attachment Style, Mental Health, and Children’s Emotional Vulnerabilities (Berant et al., 2008)**

- Investigated interplay among mothers’ attachment style, mental health, marital satisfaction, and children’s emotional vulnerabilities.
- No unique contribution of mother's attachment anxiety level or severity of child's CHD to changes in mental health by Time 3.
- Mothers with avoidant attachment at the time of their child’s diagnosis had more symptoms than expected at T3.
- Higher mother's avoidance or anxiety score linked to less positive children's explicit self-concept 7 years later.
- Mother's attachment anxiety seemed to predispose children who suffered from severe CHD to develop a less positive explicit self-concept.

**Studies on Adolescents and Depressive Symptoms (Kobak et al., 1991; Cole-Detke & Kobak, 1996)**

- Insecure attachment in general, and anxious-preoccupied attachment specifically, linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms.
- Depressed teens perceived higher levels of maternal dominance and expressed higher levels of dysfunctional anger during problem-solving episodes.
- Women with primarily hyperactivating (anxious-preoccupied) attachment strategies had significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than those with deactivating, dismissing strategies.

**Studies on Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder and Dysthymic Disorder (Patrick et al., 1994; Fonagy et al., 1996)**

- Dysthymic patients had a significant representation of preoccupied attachment and unresolved status with respect to trauma compared to borderline patients.
- Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were more likely to be secure than either bipolar or dysthymic patients.
- Scores on the AAI Anger scale were significantly higher for the MDD group than for the bipolar and dysthymic groups.

**Studies on Suicidality (DeJong, 1992; Adam et al., 1996; Riggs & Jacobvitz, 2002)**

- Individuals with a history of suicidality had less secure attachment to their parents as measured by the IPPA and compared to nondepressed students.
- Unresolved adults were more likely to report emotional distress, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse than those with resolved status.
- Preoccupied adults reported a significantly higher likelihood of suicidal ideation than those with other attachment classifications.
- Dismissing women had significantly lower levels of depression.
- Unresolved status for trauma or loss reported greater suicidal ideation, emotional distress, and substance abuse than those with resolved status.

### ATTACHMENT AND BIPOLAR DISORDER

**Attachment and Bipolar Disorder**

- Berry, Barrowclough, and Wearden (2007) reviewed studies on attachment status in patients with psychosis, including bipolar disorder.
  - Higher levels of insecure attachment, specifically dismissing attachment, in samples with psychosis compared to controls.
  - Schizophrenia patients had higher levels of insecurity than those with affective diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder and major depression.

**Studies on Attachment and Bipolar Disorder**

- Dozier (1990) gave the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to 42 psychotic patients, 25 with bipolar disorder:
  - Patients with bipolar disorder had less secure attachment than schizophrenics using Q-sort method.
  - Dismissing attachment associated with externalizing focus in bipolar patients.
  - Psychotic patients with dismissing strategies had more symptoms, while those with hyperactivating strategies reported greater symptom severity.

- Dozier et al. (1991) assessed AAI transcripts of 21 schizophrenics, 11 bipolar patients, and 8 major depressive disorder patients:
  - Narratives of bipolar patients were more likely to be classified as Ds.

**Findings from the Text**

- In a study mentioned earlier, Fonagy et al. (1996):
  - Bipolar disorder patients were more likely to be classified as Ds (38%) than MMD (7%) or dysthymic patients (14%).
  - Narratives of bipolar patients characterized by derogation during hypomanic or manic states.

- In an orphanage study:
  - 14 of 45 subjects had a type II bipolar disorder diagnosis.
  - No bipolar type I or psychotic bipolar subjects in the sample.
  - Bipolar type II subjects were significantly more likely to have insecure than secure attachment on the AAI.
  - Most AAIs were scored as disorganized (CC).
- Previous studies using the AAI identified Ds classification as overrepresented in bipolar (mostly type I) subjects, but this study found an overrepresentation of disorganization (CC) in bipolar type II subjects.

**Attachment and Somatic Symptom Disorders, Factitious Disorders, and Malingering** (Not directly related to the text)
- The text does not provide information on attachment and somatic symptom disorders, factitious disorders, or malingering.

### SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDERS

**Somatic Symptom Disorders**

- Waldinger, Schulz, Barsky, and Ahern (2006) investigated the role of insecure attachment in adult somatization.
  - Data set consisted of couples with abuse histories and recent violence.
  - Used Somatic Symptom Inventory (SSI), Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) Hypochondriasis scale and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) Somatization scale.
  - 56% of women, 17% of men reported childhood trauma.
  - Women reported more emotional abuse, men reported more physical abuse.
  - Trauma correlated with somatization for both genders.
  - Childhood trauma shapes adult attachment and influences somatization process.

**Assessing Attachment in Medical Patients**

- Maunder and Hunter (2009) reviewed methods for assessing attachment style.
  - Important in understanding symptom presentations in medical patients.
  - Assessing attachment may help adapt medical care to patient's strengths and vulnerabilities.

**Attachment Style and Somatization in Female Primary Care Patients**

- Ciechanowski, Walker, Katon, and Russo (2002) studied female primary care patients.
  - Anxious-preoccupied and fearful attachment styles related to symptom reporting and health care utilization.
  - Anxious-preoccupied women reported more symptoms, had more visits, and higher healthcare costs.
  - Fearfully attached women had least number of visits and lowest healthcare costs.

**Attachment Representations in Patients with Somatoform Disorders**

- Waller, Scheidt, and Hartmann (2004) used the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to investigate attachment representations in patients with somatoform disorders.
  - Significantly more somatoform patients were classified as insecure on AAI.
  - Dismissing somatoform patients had less frequent physician visits but greater number of hospital admissions.
  - Preoccupied somatoform patients had more physician visits and fewer hospitalizations.
  - Somatization correlated positively with dismissing attachment.

**Attachment in Patients with Somatoform Pain Disorder**

- Neumann, Nowacki, Roland, and Kruse (2011) gave AAI to patients with somatoform pain disorder and control subjects.
  - All somatoform pain patients had insecure attachment.
  - Significantly lower parental loving scores and higher parental rejection scores on AAI parenting scales for somatoform patients.
  - Somatoform patients had significantly higher scores on angry preoccupation on AAI state-of-mind scales.
  - Overall coherence of transcript and mind was significantly lower, unresolved status with respect to trauma was significantly higher in somatoform patients than controls.

**Attachment and Alexithymia in Patients with Idiopathic Spasmodic Torticollis**

- Scheidt et al. (1999) administered AAI and Toronto Alexithymia Scale to patients with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis and control subjects.
  - Dismissing attachment was significantly more prevalent in the torticollis group than in controls.
  - Alexithymia was also significantly more prevalent in the torticollis group than in controls.
  - Conclusion: Alexithymia in adults is significantly interrelated with mental representation of attachment.

**Attachment and Conversion Disorder in Children**

- Kozlowska and Williams (2009) studied attachment in children with conversion disorder using Dynamic-Maturational Model assessment system.
  - Twelve children had inhibitory attachment strategy, twelve had excitatory attachment strategy, four had alternating inhibitory/excitatory attachment strategy.
  - Attachment style related to type of conversion symptom: Negative CD symptoms related to inhibitory attachment style, positive CD symptoms related to excitatory attachment style.

### FACTITIOUS DISORDERS

**Factitious Disorders**

- Originally part of the "hysteria" category in DSM-II (1978)
- Hyler and Spitzer argued for greater conceptual clarity and empirical reliability
- Split hysteria into four categories: (1) histrionic personality disorder, (2) somatoform disorders, (3) dissociative disorders, and (4) factitious disorders

**Factitious Disorders vs. Somatoform Disorders**

- Factitious disorders involve voluntary production of physical or mental symptoms for attention
- Somatoform disorders involve involuntary experience of physical symptoms
- Conceptually separated in DSM-III, but naturally covary for some patients

**Definition and Characteristics of Factitious Disorders**

- Artificial production or simulation of a disease or history
- Involves deliberate deception and intentional self-harm
- Three essential clinical features: pathological lying, recurrent simulated illnesses, assuming sick role
- Compulsive need for attention and caretaking
- Interrelated with attachment disturbance

**Etiology of Factitious Disorders**

- Developmental disturbance
- Early childhood deprivation or difficult relationships with parents
- Abnormal illness behavior arises from problems in attachment, bonding, and caretaking
- Arrested self and self-esteem development
- Insecure attachment and unresolved trauma or loss are likely important factors
- Narcissistic pathology and disorders of self-regulation common

**Consequences of Factitious Disorders**

- Unstable, protean sense of self
- Vulnerability to self-fragmentation
- Impostor identity
- Adaptive attempt to prevent total fragmentation of an unstable sense of self by asserting and reinforcing false identities (some experts' view)

### MALINGERING

**Study by Pianta, Egeland, and Adam (1996): Attachment and Validity Scales on MMPI-2**

* Main purpose: Examine relationship between self-reported psychiatric symptoms on MMPI-2 and attachment status
* Valuable data emerged about attachment's relation to validity scales

**Attachment and Validity Scales**

* Dismissing attachment:
  * Assessed with AAI Q-sort method
  * Reported little psychiatric distress
  * Associated with minimization or "fake" good profile on MMPI-2
* Preoccupied attachment:
  * Highest on a range of psychiatric symptoms
  * Associated with exaggeration or "fake" bad profile on MMPI-2
  * Significantly more likely to score in elevated range on Response Infrequency (F) scale
  * Portray extreme psychological and emotional distress, possibly exaggerating
* All invalid MMPI-2 profiles had insecure attachment on AAI, mostly preoccupied

**Clinical Scale Scores for Preoccupied Group**

* Significantly higher than dismissing and autonomous groups on:
  * Psychopathic Deviation
  * Paranoia
  * Schizophrenia scales
* Indicates signs of impulsivity, insensitivity, suspiciousness, hostility, feelings of persecution, isolation, self-preoccupation, and inferiority

**MMPI-2 Profiles for Dissociative Coping with Trauma**

* Significant elevations on Infrequency (F) scales and Schizophrenia (Sc) scale common in subjects with dissociative coping
* Important to assess raw and T scores on F, F-back, and F-p scales, as well as use other tests for discrimination
* Disorganized (CC) status more representative of significant elevations of F and Sc than preoccupied status on AAI

**Limitations and Additional Findings**

* Pianta et al. did not use five-way classification, many preoccupied subjects may have had a combination of preoccupied and dismissing attachment strategies
* Subjects with preoccupied attachment and unresolved status for trauma or loss had elevation on Sc scale, possibly related to dissociation

**Orphanage Study: Attachment, Malingering Probability Scale (MPS), and Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS)**

* Insecure attachment and low coherence of mind significantly related to increased probability of exaggerating or fabricating psychiatric symptoms
* Factitious individuals and certain malingerers have insecure attachment and histories of chronic illnesses, learned to produce symptoms for unmet attachment needs satisfaction from medical system.

### Trauma-Related Disorders

**Trauma-Related Disorders**

* **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**
  * Pielage, Gerlsma, and Schaap (2000) study on attachment styles and psychopathology:
    * Secure attachment negatively correlated with experienced stressful events and psychological symptoms
    * Fearful and preoccupied attachment positively correlated with stressful events and psychological symptoms
    * No significant correlation in dismissing category
  * Attachment theory suggests that insecure attachment styles increase vulnerability to psychological symptoms, but reverse causality is also possible
* Alexander (1993) study on incest victims:
  * Significant differences in endorsement of attachment styles between victims and normative group
  * Secure attachment associated with least avoidance on Impact of Event Scale's Avoidance scale
* Whiffen, Judd, and Aube (1999) study on childhood sexual abuse and depression:
  * No correlation between depressive symptoms and a history of sexual abuse
  * Women with more severe abuse history had elevated attachment anxiety while maintaining confidence in partners' dependability
* Ein-Dor et al. (2010) study on veterans and their wives:
  * Higher attachment anxiety in veterans and their wives correlated with PTSD and secondary traumatic stress severity
  * Avoidant status of veterans and their wives associated with PTSD and secondary trauma only in couples with a former captive soldier
* Fraley et al. (2006) study on adult attachment style and psychological adaptation after the World Trade Center attacks:
  * Insecure attachment not related to initial or changed levels of PTSD or depression symptoms
  * Secure individuals exhibited modest initial levels of PTSD symptoms that decreased over time, and lower symptoms at both assessments compared to insecure individuals
* Wallis and Steele (2001) study on adolescents hospitalized on psychiatric units:
  * All participants had experienced childhood loss or abuse
  * Attachment was measured using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)

**Key Concepts:**

* Secure attachment is negatively correlated with stressful events and psychological symptoms.
* Fearful and preoccupied attachment styles are positively correlated with stressful events and psychological symptoms.
* Insecure attachment may increase vulnerability to psychological symptoms, but reverse causality is also possible.
* Childhood trauma experiences can influence attachment style development.
* Different attachment styles have varying correlations with PTSD and depression symptoms.

### Dismissing attachment and unresolved status with respect to trauma or loss were overrepresented in the sample: F, 10%; Ds, 51%; E, 28%; CC, 10%; and U

**Study Findings on Attachment and Trauma in Adolescents and Adults**

**Adolescent Sample:**
- Dismissing attachment and unresolved status overrepresented: F (10%), Ds (51%), E (28%), CC (10%), Ud (59%).
- High level of loss and trauma in childhood histories.
- Unresolved loss more likely to be resolved for those experiencing it alone compared to those with a combination of loss, physical abuse, and sexual abuse.

**Study by Stovall-McClough et al. (2008):**
- Women aged 18-65 with histories of severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse.
- Using Attachment Anxious Preoccupied (E) classifications: E1 (passively preoccupied), E2 (angrily preoccupied), E3 (fearfully preoccupied).
- Unresolved regarding loss and/or abuse: 50%, unresolved only for abuse: 40%.
- Dismissive classifications: 12% total, no idealizing type, 21% derogating type, 79% cognitively aware/emotionally restricted type.

**Study by Schuengel et al. (1999):**
- Examined mother–infant dyads to test Main and Hesse's hypothesis on frightening behaviors and disorganized infant attachment.
- Mothers with unresolved loss had highest scores for frightening behavior, while those with a secure representation of attachment had very low scores.
- Frightening caregiver behavior forecasted disorganized infant attachment.

**Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn (2009) Review:**
- Adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved.

**Stalker and Davies (1995):**
- Insecure attachment status, notably preoccupied attachment, predicts unresolved status for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.

**Maternal Unresolved Attachment and Frightened/Frightening Behavior:**
- Correlation between maternal unresolved attachment classification, maternal frightened behavior, and infant attachment disorganization (Iyengar et al., 2014; Jacobvitz et al., 1997; Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz, 1999; Madigan et al., 2006; Thalhuber et al., 1998).

**Clinical Implications:**
- Interventions should address both the individual's traumatic experiences and caregivers' frightened/frightening behaviors.
- Every individual can establish earned secure attachment, regardless of their attachment classification and severity.

### ATTACHMENT AND DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS

**Attachment and Dissociative Disorders**

* Nilsson, Holmqvist, and Jonson (2011) studied the relationship between attachment style and dissociative symptoms.
* Used a modified version of the Experiences in Close Relationships scale (ECR).
* Two dimensions: avoidance and anxiety.
* Modifications: subjects endorsed items based on closest relationship and were asked about whom they were thinking about.

**Findings:**

* Self-reported attachment style correlated with dissociation more than number of potentially traumatic events.
* Secure attachment might protect against dissociative symptoms.
* Anxious attachment style more prevalent in group with more trauma and dissociative symptoms.

**Coe et al. (1995) Study:**

* Measured four types of dissociative experience: memory disturbance, absorption, isolation, fragmentation.
* Insecure attachment linked to increased levels of dissociation and childhood violence.
* Secure attachment showed fewer dissociative symptoms and lower reports of childhood violence.

**Additional Findings:**

* Fearful attachment style related to memory disturbance, violence in childhood, depersonalization, and derealization.
* Preoccupied attachment style correlated with absorption.
* Dismissing attachment style showed only modest degree of dissociative isolation; infrequent reporting of dissociative absorption predicted dismissing attachment style.

### DEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION DISORDER (DRD)

**Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DRD)**

- Previously known as Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) before DSM-IV
- Defined by persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both

**Depersonalization:**

- Alteration in perception or experience of self
- Feeling detached from mental processes or body
- Characterized by vigilant alertness and profound inhibition of emotional feelings
- Diminished autonomic response to emotional stimuli and blunted pain response
- Symptom categories: emotional numbing, disembodiment, anomalous subjective recall and disruption of self-experience

**Derealization:**

- Alteration in perception or experience of the world and surroundings
- Feeling as if in a fog or dream

**Research on DPD:**

- Demonstrated to be a distinct disorder from other dissociative disorders and psychiatric conditions (Simeon et al., 1997)
- Factor analysis identified symptom categories: emotional numbing, disembodiment, anomalous subjective recall and disruption of self-experience, derealization (Sierra and David, 2011)

**Study on Adults with Childhood Sexual Abuse:**

- 12 participants had clinically significant depersonalization
- 7 participants had clinically significant derealization
- Anxious-Avoidant Attachment Interview (AAI) primary classification of insecure (mostly disorganized) attachment significantly associated with depersonalization and derealization (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively)
- Secure attachment status protected children from developing depersonalization or derealization in adulthood.

### DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER (DID)

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**

- Defined by existence of two or more alter personality states, loss of executive control, and amnesia for experiences/behaviors of alter personality states (DSM-5)
- Associated with dissociative amnesia and depersonalization
- 105 somatoform symptoms highly comorbid (Nijenhuis, van der Hart, & Steele, 2002)

**Personality Functioning in DID Patients**

- Apparent normal personality structure (ANP) for everyday functioning at expense of emotional processing
- Emotional personality (EP) states for remembering and processing stressful experiences

**Attachment Interviews with DID Patients**

- Steele (2003): Five female survivors of chronic ritual abuse with suspected DID had unresolved status (Ud) and "cannot classify" (CC) on Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)
- Daniel Brown's study: Over 90% of DID patients had CC and Ud; few remaining subjects had anxious-preoccupied (E) or addressed trauma in psychotherapy

**Dissociative Disorders and Attachment**

- Each alter personality state an expression of specific unmet attachment need
- Switches from one state to another as sequential manifestations of unmet needs

**Study of DID/DDNOS Subjects**

- 3 of 45 subjects met full diagnostic criteria for DID; 17 met partial criteria (dissociative disorder not otherwise specified or DDNOS)
- Trend towards insecure attachment associated with DID/DDNOS diagnosis
- Low coherence of transcript and mind significantly correlated with dissociative disorders

**Farina et al. Study**

- 13 patients with various dissociative disorders, including DID and DDNOS, and 13 healthy control subjects
- Healthy attachment organizes states of mind and brain EEG coherence; dissociative disorders lack this effect
- 8 of 13 patients were CC on AAI, but only 1 met full diagnostic criteria for DID

**Minnesota Longitudinal Study**

- High-risk children studied from infancy through early adulthood over three decades
- Assessments of attachment status using Strange Situation Procedure and Adult Attachment Interview
- Disorganized attachment aggravated by later childhood abuse predicts dissociative disorders in adulthood

**Liotti's Three-Pathway Model**

- Exposure to frightened/frightening parental behavior results in disorganized attachment and mild dissociative symptoms (pathway 1)
- Exposure to frightened/frightening parental behavior followed by later childhood abuse results in DID (pathway 2)
- Limited exposure or offsetting caregivers results in high normal but not pathological dissociative experiences (pathway 3)

### Attachment and Addictions

**Substance Abuse and Attachment**

* Substance abuse is characterized by continued use despite negative impacts on cognitive, behavioral, and physiological systems
* Excessive use creates extreme stimulation of brain reward system, leading to dependency with tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and compulsive use

**Attachment and Substance Use in College Students (Kassel et al., 2007)**

* Anxious attachment linked to substance use and stress-motivated use of substances: tobacco, alcohol, marijuana
* Insecure attachment associated with lower self-esteem and dysfunctional attitudes

**Attachment and Substance Use in Adolescents (Allen et al., 1996)**

* Insecure attachment linked to increased incidents of hard drug use in later adolescence
* Dismissing attachment linked to conduct disorders and substance abuse

**Attachment and Substance Abuse: Drug-Addicted Mothers (Simonelli & Vizziello, 2002)**

* Majority of drug-addicted mothers had anxious-preoccupied or unresolved attachment
* Most children were insecurely attached

**Attachment and Substance Use: Alcoholics and Drug Abusers (Barone et al., 2000)**

* Overrepresentation of insecure, largely dismissing attachment in alcoholics and drug abusers

**Attachment and Substance Use: Borderline Personality Disorder with Substance Abuse/Dependency (Savov & Atanassov, 2013; Flores, 2004)**

* Drug addicts have affect dysregulation problems and deficits in mentalizing
* Addictions are attempts at self-repair for unmet developmental needs

**Attachment-Oriented Treatment of Addictions (Flores, 2004)**

* Aim is to develop healthy internal working models for attachment and affect regulation
* Substance abuse serves as a defense against processing traumatic childhood events

The studies discussed above suggest that insecure attachment, particularly anxious attachment, increases the likelihood of substance use and stress-motivated use. Insecurely attached individuals may develop dysfunctional attitudes about themselves, leading to low self-esteem and increased drug use. Additionally, unmet developmental needs drive addictions as misguided attempts at self-repair. Attachment-oriented treatment focuses on developing healthy internal working models for attachment and affect regulation to help addicts detach from their objects of addiction.

### EATING DISORDERS

**Eating Disorders and Attachment**

* Illing et al. (2010) investigated the relationship between attachment styles and eating disorder (ED) symptoms/treatment outcomes in women with EDs and a control group:
  * Women with EDs showed higher levels of insecure attachment than controls.
  * Anorexia, binge type, had highest levels of anxious and avoidant attachment.
  * Higher attachment anxiety (Need for Approval) correlated with more severe symptoms before treatment.
  * Women with highest attachment anxiety had poorest treatment outcomes.

**Attachment Styles and Disordered Eating in Athletes**

* Shanmugam et al. (2012) studied the link between attachment styles and disordered eating in young adult college and sports club athletes:
  * Positive association between eating disorder measure and both anxious and avoidant attachment.
  * Self-esteem, depression, and self-critical perfectionism mediated the link between attachment styles and eating psychopathology.

**Attachment Styles and Eating Disorders in College Women**

* Cole-Detke and Kobak (1996) found that:
  * Dismissing attachment was linked to higher eating disorder symptoms when depression was controlled.
  * Anxious-preoccupied attachment was common in women with both eating disorder symptoms and depression.

**Attachment Styles and Eating Disorders in Nonpsychotic Inpatients**

* Fonagy et al. (1996) found that:
  * Dismissing attachment, high idealization of parents, and low reflective functioning were associated with eating disorders.
  * Participants with eating disorders are perfectionists whose disorder may stem from exaggerated standards applied to themselves and parents.

**Attachment Styles and Eating Disorders in Anorexic Patients**

* Ward et al. (2001) found that:
  * Nineteen of nineteen anorexics and ten of twelve mothers were classified as insecure on the AAI.
  * Reflective-functioning scores were very low for both anorexics and their mothers.

**Attachment Styles and Eating Disorders in Anorexic Women**

* Zachrisson and Kulbotten (2006) found that:
  * Insecure attachment and unresolved status with respect to trauma were overrepresented in anorexics.
  * All anorexics were insecure with either dismissing, preoccupied, or disorganized attachment.
  * Anxiety levels were significantly higher in anorexics with dismissing attachment.

**Attachment Styles and Eating Disorders: Clinical Implications**

* Barone and Guiducci (2009) found that:
  * The majority of ED patients had insecure attachment, mostly of the dismissing type.
  * ED patients had significantly greater parental rejection, involving, and neglect on the AAI parenting scales.
  * ED patients had a significantly higher lack of recall regarding attachment experiences and significantly lower coherence of transcript and coherence of mind.
* Mark Schwartz and Mike Rechtien (personal communication with D. Brown, July 2015) found that:
  * Most severe ED patients were given the cannot classify (CC) attachment classification from the five-way AAI classification system and an A/C classification from the DMM scoring system.
  * Using the AAI to set treatment goals led to a decrease in eating disorder behaviors by focusing on repairing the attachment system.

### Attachment and Personality Disorders

**Attachment and Personality Disorders**

- Meyer and Pilkonis (2005) studied the relationship between attachment styles and personality disorders using the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire.
  - Attachment Anxiety: correlated with avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, histrionic, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders. Strongest correlations with borderline and dependent. No correlation with schizoid.
  - Attachment Avoidance: correlated with avoidant, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders.
  - Quadrant findings: histrionic, borderline, and dependent in preoccupied quadrant; paranoid, obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic, and schizotypal at border of preoccupied and fearful; dismissing quadrant contained only schizoid; avoidant types in fearful (disorganized) quadrant.

- Dickinson and Pincus (2003) focused on differentiating narcissistic personality into two subtypes: grandiose and vulnerable.
  - Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ) used to assess attachment styles.
  - Grandiose narcissism: 60% secure, 16% dismissive, 13% fearful, 10% preoccupied.
  - Vulnerable narcissism: 50% fearful, 27% secure, 13% preoccupied, 10% dismissive.
  - Control group: 53% secure, 23% fearful, 17% preoccupied, 7% dismissive.

- Alexander (1993) studied the association of attachment status and personality functioning using the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory II (MCMI-II).
  - Significant correlations between attachment status and presence of a personality disorder.
  - Fearful attachment accounted for most variance on MCMI-II Avoidance scale.
  - Preoccupied and dismissing attachment associated with Dependent scale.
  - Fearful and preoccupied attachment predicted scores on Masochistic/Self-Defeating scale.
  - Preoccupied attachment most significantly associated with Borderline scale.
  - Attachment status, not abuse characteristics, predicted basic personality structure including dysfunctional manifestations.

### BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER

**Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**

* Devastating behavioral problems: self-injurious behavior (69%-75% prevalence), increased suicide risk (400 times greater than general population)
* Negatively impacts treatment efficacy for Axis I disorders
* Difficult to treat due to rapidly shifting attachment strategies and extreme ambivalence
* Important public health problem, affects 1%-3% of population, high long-term impairment

**Study by Lyons-Ruth et al. (2007)**

* Examined women with BPD and dysthymia using Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance Inventory (AAI)
* Hypothesis: lack of attuned parenting leads to unintegrated idealized and denigrated representations
* Hostile-helpless (HH) states of mind assessment: malevolent representation of attachment figures
* Women with BPD showed more hostile-helpless states than women with dysthymia
* Fearfully preoccupied (E3) states associated with providing caregiving and global devaluation
* Preoccupied (E), dismissing (D), unresolved/disorganized (Ud), and unresolved/preoccupied with anger (Ud/E3) classifications
* BPD patients had more unresolved/disorganized and E3 states than dysthymic patients

**Study by Rosenstein and Horowitz (1996)**

* Identified attachment quality in psychiatrically ill adolescents and their mothers
* Adolescents with borderline personality traits did not have preoccupied classification, but those diagnosed with BPD did
* Striking similarity between adolescents' and mothers' attachment classifications

**Study by Fonagy et al. (1996)**

* Studied patterns of attachment and psychiatric status using AAI four-way classification system and SCID-I and SCID-II
* Specific and robust relationship between BPD and attachment classification

### The BPD patients’ AAI interviews were differentiated by a combination of three characteristics: (1) They showed a higher prevalence of abuse and negle

**Text Summary:**

The following summarizes the key points from the text regarding the relationship between Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Attachment Theory:

**Characteristics of BPD Patients in Attachment Interviews:**

- Higher prevalence of abuse and neglect (89%)
- Lower ratings on Reflective Self-Function (RSF) scale
- Significantly higher scores on Lack of Resolution of Abuse or Loss scales (89%)

**Impact of Parental Attachment on BPD:**

- Individuals with severe maltreatment in childhood may inhibit mentalizing function to defend against realization of harm
- Defensive disruption of capacity to depict feelings and thoughts becomes core symptom in BPD, making resolution of traumatic stress more difficult
- Fonagy et al. found 75% of BPD patients were preoccupied, with 47% fearfully preoccupied (E3) reflecting fear of relationships
- Anxiety disorders significantly associated with E3 subclassification in BPD patients

**Comparison of Nonclinical College Students and Participants with BPD:**

- Barone found major group differences in AAI classifications: unresolved and entangled/preoccupied (E) overrepresented, secure/autonomous (F) underrepresented
- Dismissing (Ds) classifications present in similar proportions in both groups
- Qualitative differences between groups: BPD subjects with F classifications high in anger scores (F5), those with Ds had trend toward angry derogation (Ds2) or idealization (Ds1); BPD subjects with E divided between angry stance (E2) and fearful overwhelmed stance (E3)
- BPD group described fewer loving experiences from parents, more rejecting and neglecting experiences, and higher role-reversing experiences with mothers during childhood
- Clinical group scored significantly lower on metacognition and higher in terms of unresolved trauma
- BPD group scored dramatically lower on ratings of coherence of transcript and coherence of mind

**Attachment Studies and Disorders:**

- Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn: internalizing disorders, particularly BPD, overrepresented by preoccupied and unresolved attachment classifications; externalizing disorders more associated with dismissing attachment
- Agrawal et al.: all studies showed strong association between BPD and insecure attachment; most characteristic types of attachment were unresolved, preoccupied, and fearful

**Attachment Theory and Developmental Psychopathology Perspective on BPD:**

- Levy: temperament-based theory of attachment not supported; intersection between attachment and constitutional factors should be examined more closely; each study found inverse relationship between scores of borderline characteristics and secure attachment; BPD not specifically related to one type of attachment pattern; rates of unresolved attachment in BPD generally around 50%, but can be as low as 35%; newer interview studies suggest many BPD patients could be diagnosed with dismissing attachment.

### An important limitation of Levy’s findings is that most of the studies he reviewed did not use the five-way classification system. We believe that bor

**Limitations of Levy's Findings:**

- Most studies did not use the five-way classification system for Attachment Styles (CC, Ds, F, E, U)
- Use of different attachment classification systems led to inconsistent results

**Study by Crittenden and Newman (2010):**

- Compared attachment functioning of mothers with BPD to mothers without psychiatric disorders using two different AAI methods: Main and Goldwyn, Dynamic-Maturational Model (DMM)
- Using Main and Goldwyn method:
  - No secure (F) mothers with BPD
  - All BPD mothers and 3 normative mothers had unresolved (U) status
  - Eight BPD mothers had dismissing classifications (Ds), seven had preoccupied (E)
- Using DMM method:
  - All BPD mothers were unresolved, all had A/C classification
  - Mothers with BPD recalled more danger, reported more negative effects of danger, and showed more indicators of unresolved psychological trauma tied to danger
  - AAIs of BPD mothers were more complex, extreme, and had more rapid shifts in arousal
- Suggested that women with BPD experienced dangers during childhood beyond their ability to cope, leading to maladaptive adaptations

**Study by Barone, Fossati, and Guiducci (2011):**

- Focused on Axis I comorbidities associated with BPD
- Previous research showed high prevalence and severity of unresolved and preoccupied states in borderline pathology
- First study to systematically compare Axis I comorbidities in relation to attachment categories and infer developmental pathways
- Controlled key variables, used AAI as attachment assessment method
- Found that BPD is nearly always associated with insecure states of mind, particularly E and Ds patterns
- Significant differences in attachment status among four Axis I comorbidity groups:
  - Mood disorders and anxiety disorders: overrepresentation of E and Ud classifications
  - Substance abuse/dependence, alcohol abuse/dependence, eating disorders: overrepresentation of dismissing/derogating attachment style (Ds)
- Nine AAI coding-system dimensions significantly associated with selected Axis I disorders among BPD participants
- Findings suggest usefulness of assessing adult attachment mental states to customize treatment for BPD according to the Axis I disorder

**Our Study:**

- Insecure attachment (mostly disorganized) related to mixed or borderline PD in adulthood
- Past or current trauma not significantly related to mixed or borderline PD diagnosis
- Findings suggest that mixed and borderline PD are more related to early attachment disorganization than to trauma or abuse in later childhood or adulthood.

### CONDUCT DISORDER AND ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY

**Attachment Styles and Personality Disorders: A Comparison of Studies**

**Timmerman and Emmelkamp (2006) Study:**
- Conducted on Dutch prisoners, forensic inpatients, and normal controls
- Secure attachment less frequent among criminal status subjects
- Fearful attachment style not associated with Cluster B personality disorders or histrionic personality pathology
- Antisocial features correlated to dismissing attachment, borderline pathology to preoccupied style

**Rosenstein and Horowitz (1996) Study:**
- Examined adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized for affective disorder, conduct disorder, or a combined diagnosis
- Dismissing attachment linked to conduct disorders
- Adolescents with dismissing attachment organization minimize distressing thoughts and affects associated with rejection by the attachment figure

**Allen et al. (1996) Study:**
- Insecure attachment at age 25 associated with self-reported criminal behavior in adults
- Dismissing attachment organizations reported more criminal behavior than secure adults
- Young adult criminal behavior linked to male gender, derogation of attachment relationships, and lack of resolution of past trauma

**Fonagy et al. (1997) Study:**
- Prisoners had the lowest scores on Reflective Functioning Scale as compared to other groups
- Crimes committed by individuals with inadequate mentalizing capacities
- Disruptive behaviors adopted by children who receive non-optimal care to maximize parental attention

**Van IJzendoorn et al. (1997) Study:**
- Forensic subjects had a high percentage of disorganized attachment (CC) and lacked secure attachment
- Total number of personality disorder symptoms significantly related to attachment insecurity
- CC subjects, raised in institutional care, showed most personality disorders compared to other attachment groups

**Frodi et al. (2001) Study:**
- Dismissing attachment overrepresented among psychopathic criminal offenders
- No significant association between AAI classifications and degree of psychopathy as determined from Hare results
- Subjects classified as CC made contradictory attachment representations, subjects classified as Ds had high idealization of mother and poor recall of childhood experiences.

### Conclusions About Attachment Status and Psychopathology

**Attachment Status and Psychopathology: Conclusions from Research**

* This summary focuses on conclusions drawn from research using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to assess attachment status and its relationship with psychopathology.
* Clinical samples are characterized by a high prevalence of insecure attachment, specifically the unresolved (U) and dismissing (D) categories.
* Disorders with an internalizing dimension (e.g., borderline personality disorders) are associated with more preoccupied and unresolved attachments. Disorders with an externalizing dimension (e.g., antisocial personality disorders) display more dismissing as well as preoccupied attachments.
* Depressive symptomatology is linked to insecurity but not unresolved loss or trauma. Adults with abuse experiences or PTSD are mostly unresolved.
* The failure to use a five-way or even four-way classification model in many studies limits the ability to establish consistent relationships between specific types of insecure attachment and specific psychiatric disorders.
* In extremely disturbed individuals, the quality or type of attachment representation may not be adequately described by current attachment concepts nor established with the AAI coding system.
* The CC (cannot classify) classification is likely the primary classification in forensic and inpatient psychiatric settings. It represents pervasive disorganization across the AAI transcript, not topic-specific disorganation as in unresolved status.
* Research should focus on refining the CC category into a range of subtypes to further differentiate attachment disorganization.
* Challenges when administering the AAI to nonnormative samples include identifying primary attachment figures, probing for unresolved loss, dealing with extreme derogation and idealization, and addressing abuse by caregivers and psychotic processes.
* The AAI offers great promise for understanding attachment dynamics and their relation to wellbeing and psychopathology.
* Use of the AAI and an appropriate scoring system is essential for treating patients with complex disorders like PTSD, borderline personality disorder, dissociative disorders, and treatment-resistant patients.
* Attachment disturbances have significant individual and societal implications.

### The Orphanage Study: Attachment and Complex Trauma

**The Orphanage Study: Attachment and Complex Trauma**

- **Background:** Daniel Brown conducted a large number of forensic evaluations for civil lawsuits against alleged child abusers in the context of the Catholic orphanage in New Orleans (1950s-1960s).
- **Orphanage Abuse:** Allegations involved two priests and five staff members, many with prior abuse accusations. An organized culture of abuse emerged, leading to extensive physical and sexual abuse of numerous orphans.
- **Memory Recovery:** Victims began recalling sexual abuse memories between 2004-2006 due to media exposure. Lawsuits were settled before trials.
- **Assessment:** Between 2005-2006, Brown conducted a detailed forensic psychological assessment of each victim.
- **Unique Features:** Sample represents victims of an entire organized culture of abuse, all abused by the same group during the same time frame.
- **Attachment Interviews:** All subjects underwent Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), revealing 60% insecure attachment (disorganized type).
- **Background Differences:** Two groups: chaotic families with high risk of disorganized attachment vs large, loving Catholic families with secure attachment.
- **Impact:** Despite differences, both groups were abused by the same offenders.
- **Study Significance:** Allows separation of early attachment status and childhood abuse effects on adult psychopathology.

### To increase the statistical power, we also examined a second mixed group of CSA victims. Group A comprised the 17 subjects described above, and Group 

**Study Overview:** The study examined two groups of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) victims, Group A (17 subjects from an orphanage with same offenders) and Group B (28 adult survivors with different offenders). Both groups underwent similar forensic examinations.

**Group Comparison:**
- Few significant differences between the two groups, leading to a pooled group of 45 subjects.
- Group A had higher mean unresolved score (Ud) for trauma and more dissociative, depressed, and prone to panic attacks.
- Age range: 16-75 years, average age: 44, majority male (89%), varied educational backgrounds, mostly white (87%) and Catholic (84%).

**Assessments:** All subjects were given the same set of instruments to evaluate:
1. Attachment status using Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and Experience of Close Relationships scale (ECR)
2. Axis I depression and anxiety conditions using SCID-I, Beck Depression Inventory–1, Penn State Worry Scale, and Body Sensations Questionnaire
3. PTSD using Trauma Symptom Inventory and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale
4. Dissociative conditions using SCID-D, Dissociation Questionnaire, and Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire
5. Axis II conditions using SCID-II and Young Schema Questionnaire–III
6. Other instruments: Index of Self Esteem, Fear of Negative Evaluation scale, and Social Avoidance and Distress Scale

**Findings:**
- Preliminary analyses focused on the relationship between attachment classifications (secure vs. insecure) and various psychiatric diagnoses.
- High coherence of transcript and mind were associated with fewer diagnoses.
- Insecure attachment was significantly related to a mixed PD or borderline PD diagnosis using both SCID-II and YSQ-III.
- Subjects with insecure attachment had more negative, maladaptive schemas.

### A relationship between insecure attachment (coupled with Ud status) and dissociative disorders was also confirmed. Using the SCID-D (Steinberg, 1993),

**Attachment and Dissociative Disorders**

- A study using SCID-D identified 4 subjects with full DID and 17 with DDNOS (distinctive "parts" but not meeting full DID criteria) out of a total of 45 subjects.
- Insecure attachment was related to DID/DDNOS, but the correlation narrowly missed significance level.
- Low coherence of transcript and mind on the AAI were significantly correlated with DID/DDNOS diagnosis.
- Depersonalization and derealization were more prevalent in insecure subjects than secure ones.
- Seven out of seven subjects with a derealization diagnosis had insecure attachment and unresolved status regarding past trauma.
- Ten out of twelve subjects with depersonalization had insecure attachment.

**Attachment and Bipolar Disorder**

- All bipolar subjects (n = 14) had type II bipolar disorder on the SCID-I, eleven with insecure and three with secure attachment on the AAI.
- Insecure attachment was significantly related to bipolar type II diagnosis.

**Attachment and Self-Esteem, Fear of Negative Evaluation, Social Avoidance/Distress**

- Significant Chi-squares were observed when insecure/secure attachment was cross-tabulated with self-esteem, fear of negative evaluation, and social avoidance/distress.
- A logistic regression showed that fear of negative evaluation was sufficient to predict insecurity 73% of the time.

**Attachment and Other Psychiatric Disorders**

- No significant statistical relationships were found between insecure attachment and major depressive disorder, dysthymia, panic disorder, or somatoform disorder.
- Insecure attachment was not significantly related to PTSD based on TSI and CAPS scores.

**Attachment and Substance Abuse**

- No significant statistical relationships were found between insecure status or coherence of discourse on the AAI and alcohol or drug abuse/dependency on the SCID-I.

**Malingering and Attachment**

- Significant Chi-squares were observed when insecure/secure attachment was cross-tabulated with malingering probability scale (MPS) and total malingering score on the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS).
- Subjects with higher malingering probability scores had significantly lower coherence of transcript.

**Implications for Complex Trauma Treatment**

- Complex trauma is often characterized by multiple, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.
- Early attachment disturbance may account for complex trauma and/or multiple comorbidities independent of or in combination with abuse.
- Recognition of the role of early attachment failure opens the door to reconsideration of its contribution to complex trauma etiology.

### An important exception to trauma bias in the complex trauma literature is Alexander’s research (1993) on women survivors of childhood sexual abuse. In

**Two Pathways to Complex Trauma: Attachment and Abuse**

- *Alexander's research (1993)* on women survivors of childhood sexual abuse identified two separate pathways to complex trauma:
  - Insecure attachment contributing to personality disorders
  - Abuse per se contributing to PTSD and other Axis I anxiety and affective conditions

**Evidence from Prospective Studies**

- Childhood abuse causally related to:
  - Development of conduct and relational problems in adolescence (Widom, 1999)
  - Emergence of psychiatric conditions in early adulthood, such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, somatoform symptoms, and addictions (Silverman et al., 1996; Putnam, 1998; Widom et al., 1995)
- Emergence of multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions in adulthood as a consequence of abuse is common (Brown, 2001; Putnam, 1998)
- Use of dissociative coping style to handle abuse predicts greater severity and range of psychiatric conditions in adulthood (Putnam, 1998)

**Contributions from Attachment Research**

- Early childhood insecure attachment is related to the emergence of significant areas of psychopathology in adolescence and adulthood (Putnam, 1998; Silverman et al., 1996; Widom, 1999)
- Childhood disorganized or resistant insecure attachment status is a risk factor for:
  - Development of personality disorders (Barone, 2003; Fonagy et al., 1996; Patrick et al., 1994; van IJzendoorn et al., 1997)
  - Anxiety disorders (Bosquet & Egeland, 2006; Warren et al., 1997)
  - Addictions in adulthood (Widom et al., 1995)
- Combination of disorganized attachment and later childhood abuse predicts development of dissociative disorders in adulthood (Carlson, 1998; Liotti, 1997; Ogawa et al., 1997)

**Two Lineages of Long-Term Effects of Trauma**

- Simple PTSD:
  - Associated with single or cumulative traumatic events per se
  - Manifests mainly in Axis I psychiatric conditions like PTSD, affective and/or depressive symptoms, and sometimes addictive behaviors
- Complex trauma:
  - Outcome of a combination of early childhood insecure attachment aggravated by abuse or trauma in later childhood or adulthood
  - Manifests as complex trauma-related disorders with somatoform symptoms, personality disorder, major dissociative disorder or multiple dissociative symptoms, and often multiple addictive behaviors
  - Multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions are common, with 5 to 10 discrete DSM diagnoses possible.

### In summary, simple PTSD is associated with single or cumulative specific trauma events, whereas complex trauma is primarily associated with insecure a

**Simple PTSD vs. Complex Trauma**

* Simple PTSD: associated with single or cumulative specific trauma events
* Complex Trauma: primarily associated with insecure attachment aggravated by abuse or trauma in later childhood or adulthood
* Early childhood insecure attachment is a key factor in complex trauma development

**Findings from Orphanage Study**

* Axis I conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety) related to traumatic acts
* Personality disorders (borderline, dissociative disorders, bipolar type II) linked to insecure attachment and low coherence of discourse on the Attachment Interview (AAI)
* Insecure attachment disrupts developmental lines: affect, self, positive internal working models
* Long-term effects may lead to mixed or borderline personality disorder
* Dissociative symptoms not caused by abuse per se but by early insecure attachment and later trauma

**False Memory Cases**

* Patients initially came for treatment unrelated to abuse
* Developed memories of childhood sexual abuse and dissociative symptoms
* Diagnosed with multiple personality disorder or dissociative identity disorder
* Lawsuits against clinicians for allegedly implanting false memories
* Many plaintiffs coached by attorneys and false-memory proponents
* Defendant clinicians used standard trauma processing methods (trauma-focused, cognitive-behavioral)

**Lessons Learned**

* Trauma processing may be contraindicated for patients with disorganized attachment aggravated by later childhood abuse
* Focus on treating disorganized attachment first using attachment-based methods
* Once high coherence of mind is achieved, trauma processing can be effective without causing further disorganization.

### PART III TREATMENT BACKGROUND AND THE THREE PILLARS MODEL OF COMPREHENSIVE ATTACHMENT REPAIR CHAPTER 6 An Overview of Treatments for Attachment Distur

**Part III: Treatment Background and the Three Pillars Model of Comprehensive Attachment Repair**

**Chapter 6: An Overview of Treatments for Attachment Disturbances**

- This chapter provides an overview of treatment approaches for attachment disturbances, focusing on those representative of the types and forms developed since Bowlby and Ainsworth's pioneering work.
- **Bowlby's Attachment-Based Psychotherapy:**
  - Originated from Bowlby's work in "A Secure Base" (1988).
  - Therapist provides a secure base for exploration of attachment themes, past and present.
  - Focus on the influence of early experiences on the transference relationship.
  - Goal: Develop a more positive internal working model for attachment.
  - Applicable to patients with disturbances in their capacities to make secure attachments due to outright threats or ongoing patterns of parental unresponsiveness or misresponsiveness.
- **Principles:**
  * Therapist as a secure base: Encourages exploration and provides support, encouragement, sympathy, and guidance.
  * Exploration of attachment experiences, feelings, representations, and expectancies about past attachment figures.
  - Reappraising and restructuring internal working models for healthy attachment.
- **Methods:**
  * Secure base: Therapist offers a safe environment for patients to explore their attachment themes.
  * Transference relationship: Focus on the influence of early experiences on the therapeutic alliance.
  * Reconstruction: Exploring memories of the past and deep reluctance to disobey past orders.
- **Limitations:**
  * Time-consuming and resource-intensive.
  * Requires a well-trained therapist with expertise in attachment theory and psychotherapy.

### Psychoanalytic Approaches

**Psychoanalytic Approaches**

- John Bowlby received attention for his work on attachment problems and therapeutic relationship departing from psychoanalytic strictures.
- Lawrence Hedges' method in "Remembering, Repeating, and Working Through Childhood Trauma" (1994):
  - Interpreting resistance to and defenses against attachment.
  - Interpreting transference of organizing period and maternal failure.
  - Allowing the organizing transference to develop.
  - Consolidating sense of self, reflexive mental states, and new template for relatedness.
- Malcolm West and Adrienne Keller's attachment-based approach (1994):
  - Treating patients with personality disorders based on Bowlby's observations on childhood loss and mourning.
  - Understanding loss as experience of what was never present, not just actual separation.
  - Acknowledging the loss to complete delayed mourning process.
  - Focusing on therapist as secure base for patient.
  - Differentiating dismissing vs anxious-preoccupied attachment styles and their exploration targets.
  - Addressing intrapsychic conflict, "desire–fear drama."
  - Interpreting transference to separate desire from fear and provide corrective emotional experiences.

### Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy

**Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy**

- Emerged as a response to the lessening adherence to strict psychoanalytic notions in psychotherapy
- Maintains focus on intrapsychic functioning while emphasizing cognitive, relational, and systemic factors
- Draws from attachment theory and other psychological understandings (Bowlby, Ainsworth, Stern, Trevarthen, Main, Fonagy)

**Attachment, Intimacy, Autonomy (Holmes, 1996)**

- Goals:
  * Attachment system: adult intimacy
  * Exploratory system: autonomy of the self
- Secure base experience with therapist:
  * Foundation for broader security of attachment and healthy self-autonomy
  * Therapist behaves like a responsive, attuned parent-figure
- Therapeutic process:
  * Establish secure base
  * Use it as starting point for exploration of dysfunctional attachment themes
  * Encourage patient to explore transference to therapist
  * Therapeutic stance: interested nonreactivity and capacity for detached reflection
- Dual focus: attachment and autonomy
- Ruptures and failures of empathy in treatment are inevitable, but can lead to new internal working model of attachment
- Development of a healing narrative leads to tolerance of separation anxiety and independence from therapist

**Attachment Patterns**

- Dismissing:
  * First task is to establish emotional contact
- Anxious-preoccupied:
  * Highly dependent
  * Distressed around separation
  * Key issue: expression of appropriate anger at separation
- Disorganized:
  * Will develop borderline personality disorder
  * Treatment entails unhooking role-reversing patterns and moving beyond longing and loss

### CLINICAL PATTERNS OF ATTACHMENT

**Attachment and Adult Psychotherapy: A Bowlby-Based Approach by Pat Sable**

* Sable presents an attachment perspective for treating attachment disorders in adults, not an attachment-based treatment (2000, p. 88)

**Bowlby's Attachment Theory**

* Attachment is about safety and protection
* Seeking proximity and emotional availability of therapist
* Attachment behavior is lifelong and active throughout the life-cycle
* Individuals lack confidence in the availability of affectional figures, leading to dysfunctional internal working models (IWMs) (p. 101)

**Goals of Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy**

* Establish therapist as a stable attachment figure
* Modify dysfunctional IWMs
* Change IWMs through exploration and understanding of past experiences

**Establishing a Secure Base**

* Provide regular appointments, emotional availability, comfort, and safety
* Support development of greater self-reliance (p. 144)

**Exploration Process in Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy**

1. Retrieve defensively excluded memories and feelings
2. Validate emotions associated with early attachment experiences
3. Map out past IWMs of attachment
4. Correct transference distortions and distortion in IWMs
5. Develop a coherent narrative (p. 345)

**Unique Features of Therapy Relationship**

* Safe base for exploration of early dysfunctional attachment experiences
* Trusted companion supporting development of greater self-reliance
* Opportunity to investigate and reexperience past experiences with empathy, support, and guidance (pp. 332–333)

**Benefits of Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy**

* Understanding how working models have been generated and maintained
* Moving away from abusive affectional ties towards healthier relationships
* Leads to greater self-reliance based on confidence in the therapist (pp. 299, 345)

### ATTACHMENT-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY

**Attachment-Based Psychotherapy (ABP)**

* Developed by Karl Heinz Brisch, based on Bowlby's and Ainsworth's theories
* Therapist acts as a secure attachment figure
* Encourages patients to explore and understand their attachment strategies
* Focuses on recognizing and updating outdated representations of self and objects in current relationships
* Goal: Help patients establish greater awareness of attachment strategies and their appropriateness for current life

**Dynamic-Maturational Model Integrative Treatment (DMM)**

* Developed by Patricia Crittenden
* Attachment behavior reflects organized strategies for coping with danger and seeking protection
* Maladaptive behavior results from exposure to unprotected and uncomforted danger
* Focus on repairing and modifying problematic dynamics within individuals and family systems
* Parents' experiences and coping strategies are crucial in addressing attachment issues
* Goal: Enable individuals to generate and apply self-protective strategies at the right time and context for psychological balance

**Common Themes**

* Attachment patterns play a significant role in understanding and treating mental health issues
* Importance of recognizing and updating outdated representations of self and objects
* Focus on repairing and modifying problematic dynamics within individuals and family systems
* Emphasis on enabling individuals to generate and apply self-protective strategies for psychological balance
* Long-term goal: Change information processing to promote adaptive and functional behavior in current and future circumstances.

### Regarding treatment methods and the process itself, Crittenden emphasizes that “good assessment, good formulation, and good therapeutic relationships”

**Crittenden's DMM Integrated Treatment**

- Essential components: good assessment, formulation, and therapeutic relationships (Crittenden, 2008)

**Assessment** in Crittenden's Dynamic-Maturational Model (DMM):
- Yields information about dispositional representations (DRs) and protective attachment strategies
- DRs: eight types underlie each patient's behavioral tendencies
- Information-processing patterns characterize a patient's protective strategies (A, B, C, and their combinations)

**Formulation**:
- Draws from assessment information
- Understands nature, origins, and perpetuation of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and familial problems
- Generates DR and information-processing strategy formulations for diagnostic conditions (e.g., eating disorders, PTSD, factitious illness by proxy)

**Therapeutic Relationship**:
- Important for successful treatment
- Critical of manualized treatments and limiting techniques to specific schools of therapy
- Use whatever techniques best fit the goals of treatment

**General Principles of Treatment**:
1. **Danger and safety**:
   - Address patient's experience of danger in past, present, and future
   - Establish sense of safety
   - Consider potential dangers associated with therapy itself or modification of information-processing strategies
2. **Affect regulation**:
   - Help patients manage emotions
   - Develop skills for emotional self-regulation
3. **Interpersonal communication**:
   - Improve communication between family members
   - Encourage effective problem-solving and conflict resolution
4. **Cognitive restructuring**:
   - Challenge maladaptive thoughts and beliefs
   - Replace with adaptive ones
5. **Behavioral change**:
   - Teach new skills and behaviors
   - Reinforce desired behaviors
6. **Relationship building**:
   - Strengthen therapeutic relationship
   - Encourage attachment security and bonding between family members

**Techniques**:
- Elicit discovery, foster exploration, encourage practice
- May include medication, individual sessions, group sessions, inpatient hospitalization, or social service interventions

**Importance of Assessment and Formulation**:
- Individualized treatment based on unique needs of the patient
- Prevent missing the patient's needs or causing harm with misfit techniques
- Consistent with parenting based on attunement to child's characteristics and developmental stage.

### 2. Therapists as transitional attachment figures.

**Therapists as Transitional Attachment Figures:**

- Therapists can function as transitional attachment figures by making treatment tolerable and safe for individuals with distorted information processing strategies (Crittenden & Landini, 2011; Crittenden et al., 2014).
- More problematic adaptive strategies require stronger therapist-patient relationships, which may resemble naturally occurring attachment relationships (Crittenden, 2008).
- Qualities that increase the likelihood of a patient experiencing the therapist as a transitional attachment figure include compassion, acceptance, attunement, sensitive responsiveness, and genuine feeling, particularly comfort (Crittenden, 2008; Crittenden et al., 2014).
- The connection between the therapist and patient is the therapist's willingness to be a secure base and the patient's desire for one (Crittenden, 2008).
- The progress of the relationship is both the process and a goal of the treatment (Crittenden, 2008).

**Regulating Arousal:**

- Helping patients regulate arousal supports access to motivation, stability, and essential mental processes for therapy.
- Maintaining an appropriate level of arousal is crucial for effective therapy.

### 4. Quieting traumatic responses to current conditions. “Unresolved traumas and losses require enough exploration to make them explicit and open to dis

**Crittenden's Attachment-Based Therapy: Components and Key Concepts**

**1. Establishing a Secure Base:**
- Building a therapeutic alliance
- Creating a safe and predictable environment
- Promoting emotional regulation

**2. Quieting traumatic responses to current conditions:**
- Exploring unresolved traumas and losses
  * Unresolved loss: 12 forms (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, pp. 236–253)
  * Unresolved trauma: 14 forms (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, pp. 386–387)
- Tailoring focus and intervention based on identified forms
- Identifying maladaptive coping strategies
- Functional formulation for understanding past behavior and treatment possibilities

**3. Regulating arousal:**
- Protecting against large fluctuations in patient's arousal
- Supporting effective therapy process
- Highlighting maladaptive strategies in current circumstances

**4. Increasing family members’ repertoire of protective strategies:**
- Acquiring additional adaptive strategies
- Preventing recurrence of problems when new strategies are needed
- Functional formulation for understanding past behavior and treatment possibilities
- Identifying patient's typical existing strategies
- Selecting appropriate interventions based on over- or underrepresentation of strategies
- Considering effects of Type A and Type C strategies on treatment process

**5. Reaching coherence and resilience:**
- Promoting further resilience in current and unfamiliar circumstances
- Iterative integrative process for understanding developmental progress
- Gaining compassionate understanding of limitations of important others
- Optimism for facing new adversities while protecting oneself and loved ones.

### As Crittenden emphasizes the importance of goal-setting and working within the patient’s zone of proximal development (e.g., Crittenden et al., 2014, 

**Crittenden's Treatment Model:**

- Emphasizes goal-setting and working within the patient's zone of proximal development.
- Integrative step involves complex cortical processing, not fully possible before late adolescence.
- Reflective approaches to therapy recommended for integrative step.
  * Crittenden praises Fonagy's work on reflective function and mentalization.
  * Assumes mentalization-based methods are appropriate.
- Importance of metaprocessing with the patient during later phases of treatment (Fosha).
- Tailors interventions to individual's developmental needs and capacities.
- Examples: parents using verbal episodes, toddlers working through play enactments.
- School-aged children connecting preconscious DRs with verbal forms of representation.

**Attachment Representations and Internal Working Models:**

- Bowlby's recognition of internal working models central to attachment theories and treatment methods.
- Several approaches work directly with patients' mental representations related to attachment.

### WORKING WITH ATTACHMENT REPRESENTATIONS INDEPENDENT OF TRANSFERENCE

**Sperling and Lyons' Approach to Attachment Disorders: Focusing on Attachment Representations**

- Psychodynamically based approach to treating attachment disorders without focusing on transference reenactment (Sperling & Lyons, 1994)
- Informed by Mary Main et al.'s definition of Internal Working Models of Attachment (IWMs): a set of rules for organizing and accessing attachment-related information (Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985)

**Identifying and Modifying Attachment Representations**

- Focus on facilitating change in mental representations of attachment (p. 331)
- Interpersonal but non-enactive transferential mode with regard to the therapeutic relationship (p. 338)
- Vigilantly attend to patient's reports of current and past attachment experiences to discern representational patterns (p. 340)

**Identifying Active Representational Patterns**

- Attend to patient's reports of current and past attachment experiences
- Discerning emergent representational patterns
- Use these patterns to give meaning to current events and anticipation of future events

**Modifying Internal Working Models (IWMs)**

- Guiding the patient in constructing defining relational narratives
- Allowing for a more conscious awareness of idiosyncratic rules and expectations governing representations
- Using these markers against which new experiences can be compared and evaluated (pp. 340–341)

**Interpretations in Sperling and Lyons' Method**

- Interpretations focus on patterns of experience rather than specifically on transference with the therapist
- The interpretive process takes on a psychoeducational quality (p. 341)
- Developing new, healthy attachment relational narratives or IWMs

### IMAGERY OF THE GOOD-ENOUGH THERAPIST TOGETHER WITH THE PATIENT

**Baker's Approach to Enhancing Attachment in Psychotic and Borderline Patients**

* Elgan Baker introduced a method for enhancing relatedness in psychotic and borderline patients with attachment disturbances (1981)
* Based on British object relations theory, focusing on internalization and organization of interpersonal relationships
* Primitive forms of psychopathology conceptualized as structural deficits in ego formation due to difficulties in developmental tasks

**Fostering Attachment Bond**

* More active and nurturing role for the therapist
* Enhances attachment by gratifying dependency strivings
* Maintains connectedness during regression
* Therapist becomes a "real object" who can "hold" boundaries of reality
* Patient forms stable internal representation (cathexis) of the "good-enough" therapist

**Advantages of Hypnotic Imagery**

* Heightened state of attentiveness
* Greater inward orientation and less orientation to outside reality
* Greater access to internal emotions and memories
* More vivid and readily available imagery
* Highly structured relationship with therapist control

**Seven Steps of Treatment**

1. Patient imagines self involved in pleasant activity, evoking a stable positive representation of self
2. Patient opens eyes to see therapist focused on state, reassuring presence
3. Patient repeatedly imagines therapist as benign and supportive presence
4. Patient imagines himself/herself and therapist together with proximity, preserving clear boundaries
5. Patient imagines coordinated interactions, internalizing therapist as "good object"
6. Patient externalizes malignant internal voices or representations
7. Dynamic exploration of dysfunctional patterns and integrating positive and negative images

**Unique Contributions**

* Co-creating attachment imagery spontaneously during sessions
* Refusing canned scripts for what to say during the imagery process

### New Forms of Attachment-Informed Treatment

**Schema Therapy for Patients with Attachment Disturbances**

* Schema Therapy is a new approach to treating patients with personality disorders and attachment disturbances, developed by Jeffrey Young, Janet Klosko, and Marjorie Weishaar.
* Based on emotion-focused or experiential methods, it focuses on healing Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS).

**Concept of Maladaptive Schemas**

* EMS are self-defeating emotional and cognitive patterns that begin in childhood and repeat throughout life.
* Each schema revolves around a childhood theme and is relationally based.
* Result from unmet core emotional needs.
* Composed of memories, emotions, cognitions, and body sensations.
* Healing involves diminishing all aspects of the schema.

**Schema Domains**

1. Disconnection and Rejection: Abandonment, mistrust-abuse, emotional deprivation, defectiveness, social isolation.
2. Impaired Autonomy and Performance: Dependency, vulnerability, enmeshment, failure.
3. Impaired Limits: Entitlement, insufficient self-control.
4. Other-Directedness: Subjugation, self-sacrifice, approval-seeking.
5. Overvigilance and Inhibition: Negativity, emotional inhibition, unrelenting standards, punitiveness.

**Schema Therapy Goals**

1. Identify salient maladaptive schemas.
2. Increase conscious control over schemas.
3. Understand schema origins in childhood.
4. Heal schemas through limited reparenting and experiential techniques.

**Limited Reparenting**

* Therapist serves as an ally to fight against maladaptive schemas.
* Provides limited reparenting, supplying missed emotional experiences within ethical and professional boundaries.
* Goal: Patient internalizes a Healthy Adult mode.

**Experiential Techniques**

* Safe-place imagery.
* Evoke negative affect associated with early childhood experiences.
* Reparenting through therapist entering patient's image as a Healthy Adult.
* Teach patients there are other ways parents might have treated them.

**Overall Aim**

* Patient develops an internalized healthy adult representation, modeled after the therapist.

### [T]he therapist enters the images to take care of the child. The therapist does whatever a good parent would have done: removes the child from the sce

**Schema Therapy**

- Therapist enters patient's images to care for traumatized inner child.
  * Removes child from scene, confronts perpetrator, etc.
  * Patient eventually takes over as Healthy Adult.

**Experiential Techniques**

- Imagery work with dialogues and schema mode dialogues.
  * Safe place imagery.
  * Dialogue between patient and parent figure.
  * Encourage desired changes in parent figure.

**Schema Modes**

- Moment-to-moment emotional states and coping responses.
- Grouped into parts of the self.
  * Child modes: Vulnerable, Angry, Impulsive, Happy.
  * Maladaptive coping modes: Compliant Surrender, Detached Protector, Overcompensator.
  * Dysfunctional parent modes: Punitive, Demanding.
  * Healthy Adult mode.
- Goal: Access schema modes and initiate dialogue to resolve conflicts.

**Schema Mode Therapy**

- Behavioral homework assignments for practicing adaptive responses.
- Target self-defeating coping strategies.
- Identify problematic behaviors, coping strategies, and life patterns.
- Replace maladaptive schemas with healthy patterns.

**Attachment Connection**

- Therapist as attachment figure.
- Provides stable base for identity and self-acceptance.
- Patient internalizes therapist behaviors as Healthy Adult mode.

**Effectiveness**

- Schema therapy shown to be more effective than transference-focused treatment in treating borderline personality disorder (Geisen-Bloo et al., 2006).

### ACCELERATED EXPERIENTIAL DYNAMIC PSYCHOTHERAPY (AEDP)

**Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP)**

* Innovative attachment-informed treatment developed by Diana Fosha
* Focus on facilitating affect experience and transformation through a good attachment relationship
* Central concept: core affect

**Core Affect**

* Vital, spontaneous emotional responses when defenses are not in operation
* Defining feature: has the power to engender healing state transformations
* Goal of AEDP: increase availability and stability of core affect

**Treatment Process**

* Establish therapeutic holding environment
	+ Secure, emotionally facilitating dyadic relationship
	+ Qualities of therapist's ways of being with the patient
		- Empathic attunement
		- Recognition, affirmation, validation, and valuing of patient's experience
		- Expressing care, compassion, concern
		- Authenticity and active use of therapist's own affective experience
		- Offering encouragement and being helpful
		- Expressing delight in the patient
* Facilitate core affect to promote emergence of core states
	+ Altered condition of openness and contact with self and relational experience

**Therapist Role**

* Attentively track moment-by-moment fluctuations in patient's affective state
* Maintain accurate attunement and match/amplify patient's ongoing affective displays
* Facilitate mutual, coordinated expression of facial displays of affect
* Highlight the importance of the relationship itself as a focus of therapeutic work

**Dyadic Interaction Processes**

* Ongoing regulations: how moment-to-moment experience is received and responded to
* Heightened affective moments: intense emotional experiences in relational context
* Disruption and repair of ongoing regulations: handling disruptions within the relational dyad

### In addition to these processes of dyadic interaction and the qualities of the therapist’s ways of being with the patient, AEDP places emphasis on the 

**Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP)**

* Focuses on dyadic interaction, therapist's ways of being, patient's somatic experience, and metaprocessing
* Emphasizes transformative processes and attachment security

**Principles and Practices**

* Dyadic attunement to patient's vitality affects
* Reducing defenses and inhibiting affects
* Holding environment for transformation

**Emotion-based Transformational Process**

**State One:**

* Patient comes with distress, symptoms, dysregulated affects, inhibiting affects, defenses, and transformative strivings
* Therapist's dyadic attunement supports transformation from first state
* Signs of transformation: green signal affects, heralding affects, transitional affects
* First state transformation: full experience of core affective phenomenon

**State Two:**

* Patient feels safe in therapeutic dyad
* Processing emotional experiences
* Appearance of categorical emotions
* Relief, clarity, hope, strength, adaptive action tendencies
* Second state transformation: relief from inhibited emotions

**State Three:**

* Processing transformational experience
* Mastery affects, emotional pain, tremulous affects, healing affects, realization affects
* Shifting from core affect to core state
* Third state transformation: calm, clarity, openness, aliveness, vitality, sense of ease and relaxation

**State Four:**

* Transformation into core state
* Core state prominent and available
* Self and relational characteristics consistent with attachment security
* Defining qualities of core state: wisdom, compassion, generosity, vibrant wellbeing, equanimity, confidence, creativity, naturalness, enhanced initiative and agency, sense of the sacred, truth sense

**Unique Contribution:**

* Thorough affect transformation in dyadic patient–therapist attachment relationship
* All affective states are seeds for deeply transformative experience and development

### Intersubjectivity-Based Treatment

**Intersubjectivity-Based Treatment**

- Influenced by Beebe and Lachmann's work on intersubjectivity in the field of attachment
- Integrated into Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP)
- Based on research on intersubjectivity in infant-mother interactions

**Intersubjectivity and Adult Treatment**

*Beebe and Lachmann's Model for Treating Adults with Attachment Disturbance*

- Secure dyads: self-regulation and interactive regulation, disruption and repair, positive mutual engagement
- Primary intersubjectivity emerges from these principles
- Collaborative vs. contradictory dialogues: significant difference in nonverbal exchange
- Contradictory interactions lead to failed self-agency, expectation of misregulation, and internalization of dysregulated interaction

**Beebe and Lachmann's Approach to Psychotherapy**

- Emphasizes attunement to nonverbal exchange between patient and therapist
- Careful observation of nonverbal behavior: head orientation, body posture, gaze, facial affect display, rhythm, pitch, tone, timing of verbal responses
- Therapist matches and rematches patient's nonverbal behavior
- Addresses patterns of distancing or hyperengaging nonverbal behavior in the patient

**Methods of Treating Nonverbal Intersubjectivity Failures**

1. Sustained collaborative, noncontradictory nonverbal responsiveness from therapist
2. Videotaping and reviewing sessions to bring attention to intersubjective dynamic

**Recommendation**

- Awareness of moment-by-moment nonverbal exchange between patient and therapist essential for treating attachment disorders in adults
- Familiarity with intersubjective principles and practices recommended for therapists treating patients with insecure attachment.

### EXPLORATORY PSYCHOTHERAPY

**Exploratory Psychotherapy and Attachment Theory**

- Dorothy Heard, Brian Lake, and Una McCluskey extended Bowlby's attachment theory with a new paradigm focusing on intersubjectivity and various behavioral systems (Heard et al., 2009).

**Behavioral Systems**

- Extension to Bowlby's thinking: collaborative interest-sharing, affectional sexuality, system of personal defense, and external lifestyle system.

**Intersubjectivity**

- Manifests through intricate rhythmic patterns in dyadic exchange.
- Three aspects: communion, joint attention, and reflective and recursive communication.
- Caregiver's affect attunement vs. purposeful misattunement.

**Self Development**

- Self grows and develops both within and apart from attachment relationship.
- Withdrawal into subjectivity for self-reflection and creativity.

**Exploratory Psychotherapy**

- Restorative therapy: patient seeks care, therapist as secure base.
- First task: attenuate fear system, activate attachment system.
- Secure base enables exploration of self across behavioral systems.

**Quality of Dyadic Exchange**

- Empathic recognition and emotional communication essential for a secure base.
- Video recordings used to train therapists in nonverbal attunement.

**Patient Care-Seeking Behaviors**

- Openness, avoidance, tangled discussion, dismissal, and overwhelm.

**Therapist Caregiving Responses**

- Careful attunement, misattunement with repair, defection, withdrawal, and disorganization.

**Interaction Patterns**

- 25 potential patterns based on patient behaviors and therapist responses.

**Common Misattunements by Therapists**

- Interrupting, failing to regulate state of mind, minimal response, avoiding affect, discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal, ignoring fear activation, missing immediate affect.

**Learning Attunement**

- Through training and experience, therapists learn to genuinely attune themselves to patients, restoring wellbeing and enabling exploration.

### Metacognitive Attachment-Informed Psychotherapies

**Metacognitive Attachment-Informed Psychotherapies**

* Metacognitive functioning plays a crucial role in attachment and its disturbances.
* Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT) focuses on mentalization as a metacognitive skill.

**Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)**

* Developed by Peter Fonagy, Anthony Bateman, Jon Allen, and their colleagues.
* Central concept: mentalization.
* Mentalization is making sense of actions based on intentional mental states.
* Develops in secure attachment relationships during childhood.
* Stages in development: contingent responsiveness, marking, representation of emotions, second-order representations.
* Allows for reflective capacity and affect regulation.

**Mentalization Development**

* Security of attachment and caregiver's holding the child's mind in mind facilitate mentalization.
* Individuals with insecure attachment are at risk for failure to develop mentalization capacity.
* Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) assesses reflective functioning in adults.
* PD and DD patients lack reflective capacity.

**MBT Approaches**

* Mentalizing is a consistent therapeutic stance.
* Therapist enables patient to discover their mind in the therapist's mind.
* Tips for therapists to influence mentalizing: create a safe environment, use clear language, explore emotions, reflect on thoughts and feelings, maintain a mentalizing stance, avoid blame or criticism, encourage perspective-taking, and provide empathy and understanding.

### Promoting mentalizing • Maintaining an inquisitive, curious, not-knowing stance • Offering interventions that are simple and to the point • Promoting 

**Mentalizing-Based Therapy (MBT)**

**Promoting mentalizing:**
- Maintain curious, not-knowing stance
- Offer simple interventions
- Emotional engagement: neither too hot nor too cold
- Secure base experience
- Balance exploration of self and others' mental states
- Mirroring process: reflect patient's mental state back to them
- Judicious self-disclosure
- Validate patient's experience before offering alternative perspectives
- Multiple perspectives
- Let patient correct therapist's distorted mentalizing
- Acknowledge mistakes and misunderstandings

**Undermining mentalizing:**
- Striving to be clever or insightful
- Complicated, lengthy interventions
- Presenting ideas with certainty
- Attributing mental states based on theoretical preconceptions
- "Psychobabble"
- Prolonged silences
- Generalizing patient's experiences
- Intense reactive emotion

**Bateman's approach to MBT:**
1. Enhancing mentalization:
   - Adopt mentalizing stance
   - Use it for emotional states
2. Bridging the gap between affects and their representation:
   - Identify affect
   - Interpret moment-by-moment changes
   - Contingent mirroring
   - Understand antecedents
   - Clarify meaning
   - Improve emotional control
   - Place feelings in context
   - Learn to express feelings appropriately
3. Working mostly with current mental states
4. Keeping in mind the patient's deficits

**Mentalized affectivity:**
- Capacity to connect consciousness of an affective state to its experience at a constitutional level
- Establish congruent connections between primary and secondary affect-representational structures

**Working with cognitive states:**
1. Identify maladaptive beliefs
2. Reflect on beliefs about these beliefs and their fears/wishes (aboutness)
3. Identify ruptures in the here-and-now process
4. Mentalize the transference: highlight underlying motives
5. Keep focus on patient's deficits: encourage mentalizing, not expected or demanded

**Long-term effects:**
- Coherent sense of self
- Capacity for second-order regulation of emotional states
- Capacity for secure intimacy

### THE MODULAR APPROACH TO METACOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT

**Modular Approach to Metacognitive Development (Rome School)**

- Conceptualizes metacognition as a modular function with discrete components or subfunctions
- Identified six specific metacognitive skills, or modules:
  - **Identification**: recognizing and defining inner states (emotions, cognitions)
  - **Differentiation**: recognizing mental events as subjective and distinguishing fantasy from reality
  - **Relating variables**: establishing relations among components of mental states and between mental states and behavior
  - **Integration**: developing coherent descriptions of mental states and showing consistency
  - **Decentration**: comprehending another individual's mental state from a non-egocentric perspective
  - **Mastery**: working through representations and mental states to implement effective action strategies
- Different psychiatric diagnoses manifest specific metacognitive deficits:
  - Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): poor at differentiation, integration, and mastery
  - Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD): good at metacognitive mastery but poor at identifying states of mind in self and others
  - Major Dissociative Disorders: poor at metacognitive identification and integration
- Treatment approach focuses on improving specific deficient metacognitive subfunctions using validation, therapist self-disclosure, and encouraging patient reflection on problematic states.
- Liotti's theory for BPD and DID patients:
  - Result of early childhood disorganized attachment and later abuse
  - Characterized by multiple, fragmented, and incoherent Internal Working Models (IWMs)
  - Destabilized, shifting mental states oscillating between persecutor, rescuer, and victim roles
  - Poor metacognitive capacity, severe relational deficits, deficits in self-integration, emotional dysregulation, and dissociative experiences/behaviors
- Expanded Bowlby's concept of behavioral systems: fear system, attachment system, cooperation and collaboration system, social rank system, and sexual behavioral system.
- Patients with PDs or DDs typically activate non-attachment behavioral systems in response to threat.
- Intervention designed to activate therapeutic behavioral systems within the therapeutic relationship.

### An extraordinarily important point for therapists treating patients with attachment disturbances to remember is Liotti’s discovery that the activation

**Liotti's Discovery and Its Implications for Attachment-Based Therapy**

* Activation of attachment behavioral system in PD and DD patients early in treatment decreases mentalization capacity due to disorganization and overwhelm (Liotti, Prunetti et al., 2008)
* Validation interventions can activate emotional closeness and disorganize the patient's internal working model (IWM), hindering metacognitive abilities (Prunetti et al., 2008)
* Shifting to a collaborative behavioral system when disorganization occurs increases mentalization capacity (Liotti & Gilbert, 2011)
* Metacognitive shifts are motivation-and context-specific in PD and DD patients (Liotti & Gilbert, 2011)

**Collaborative Behavioral System: Conceptual Groundwork**

* The cooperative behavioral system is an innate motivational system necessary for group survival (Cortina & Liotti, 2010; Liotti, 1999)
* Superior cooperative and communicative abilities helped early human groups compete favorably (Cortina & Liotti, 2010)
* PD and DD patients rarely experienced collaboration in their family of origin (Liotti, 2005)
* Attachment-based therapists explicitly introduce collaboration at the onset and throughout treatment (Liotti, 1999)

**Implications for Therapeutic Strategies**

* Shift to collaborative behavioral system when attachment system activation leads to disorganization and decreased mentalization capacity
* Explicitly establish goals and rules of therapeutic work to promote collaboration between patient and therapist (Liotti, 1999)

### A therapist’s openness regarding his or her thinking about the assessment and the treatment plan 151 establishes the cooperative system and the founda

**Collaborative Foundation in Therapy**

- Therapist's openness about assessment and treatment plan establishes cooperative system (Dimaggio et al., 2007)
  * Ongoing transparency about symptom changes and need for alterations
  * Written treatment contract for mutual understanding and agreement
  * Written session summaries after each session
- Collaboration fosters mutual understanding and secure base within the treatment relationship (Liotti, 2005)
  * Sharing, working towards common goal, appreciation, and pleasure
  * Cooperative motives involve feelings of safety and trust

**Parallel Coordinated Treatments for Severe Cases**

- Combination of individual and group therapies with two primary individual therapists (Liotti et al., 2008)
- Second therapist provides support during ruptures, promoting metacognitive reflection
  * Leads to modulation of attachment, improving metacognition, and increasing security

**Cognitive Evolutionary Therapy (CET)**

- Developed by Liotti for inpatient and outpatient treatment of personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and attachment disturbances
- Key goals: helping patients reflect more skillfully on interactions and reaching a cooperative stance (Prunetti et al., 2013)

**Beyond Mentalizing: Mindfulness and Transcendence of Self**

- David Wallin extends mentalizing into the domain of mindfulness (Wallin, 2007)
- Starting point is implicit, nonverbal experience
- Therapy for insecurely attached patients focuses on mindfulness and intersubjectivity.

### Because our first relational experiences are mainly lived outside the domain of language, our crucial internalizations of early relationships register

**Early Relationships and Internal Representations**

- Our first relational experiences are mainly nonverbal and unconsciously internalized as representations, rules, and models (Wallin, 2007).
- These hard-to-reach representations can be modified only by accessing them experientially.
- In therapy, these representations may become accessible through other-than-verbal channels (Wallin, 2007).

**The Unthought Known**

- Wallin calls this nonverbal domain of implicit knowledge the "unthought known" (2007).
- Nonverbal states of mind are reenacted in the transference, evoked in the therapist, and embodied as felt experience.
- Enactment, evocation, and embodiment are primary means for patients to communicate what they know but have not thought (Wallin, 2007).

**Secure Base and Collaborative Communication**

- Wallin's crucible for transformation of experience and the self is the provision of a secure base by the therapist.
- Secure base is promoted through collaborative communication, which involves:
  - Inclusive dialogue of all domains of experience
  - Active identification and repair of ruptures
  - Upgrading dialogue to higher levels of awareness
  - Providing a real relationship with full engagement (Wallin, 2007).

**Engaging Ongoing Experience in Insecurely Attached Patients**

- Three stages of engaging ongoing experience in insecurely attached patients:
  1. Embeddedness: patient is deeply embedded in vicissitudes of ongoing experience with much implicit.
  2. Mentalizing: patient reflects on mental states rather than simply experiencing them.
  3. Mindfulness: directing awareness to moment-by-moment process of experiencing (Wallin, 2007).

**Transition from Mentalizing to Mindfulness**

- Difference between mentalizing and mindfulness: mentalizing makes sense of experience vs. mindfulness being fully present to experience.
- Through mindfulness practice, there is a transition from mentalizing focus to identification with awareness itself (Wallin, 2007).
- Mindfulness offers awareness of reflective self and the difference between reflecting upon experience and being fully present to it.
- Shift in subjectivity from representations of self to awareness itself leads to transcendence of the self (Wallin, 2007).

### A Consensus-Based Model for Attachment Treatment

**Consensus-Based Model for Attachment Treatment**

* Mallinckrodt and associates developed a model of attachment-based treatment based on expert consensus from interviews with therapists specializing in adult attachment issues (Mallinckrodt, Daly, & Wang, 2009).
* Adult attachment theory offers a useful framework for understanding and treating relational problems in adults.
* Attachment system is activated when adults perceive significant threats, making an attachment-based approach suitable for such patients.

**Types of Problematic Attachment Problems in Adults**

* Two main types: deactivating and hyperactivating strategies.

**Deactivating Strategies**

* Inflated self-esteem
* Suppressed attachment-related thoughts and feelings
* Avoidant attachment
* Reduced physiological arousal
* Project unwanted self-traits onto others
* Alexithymia regarding distress

**Hyperactivating Strategies**

* Negative beliefs about coping with distress
* Expect inconsistent responsiveness and availability from others
* Anxious attachment
* Exaggerated appraisal of perceived threats
* Fears of abandonment
* Unable to suppress painful thoughts of separation
* More alert to self-perceived weakness

**Attachment-Based Treatment Phases**

* Engagement phase:
  * Establishing a secure therapeutic relationship as a safe base for exploration.
  * Helping the client form a secure attachment.
  * Regulating closeness and distance in the therapeutic relationship based on patient's attachment style.
  * Encouraging patients with deactivating strategies to focus on their longing for connection.
  * Patient-therapist match should be complementary in terms of attachment styles.
* Working phase:
* Termination phase:

**Engagement Phase Indicators of Successful Engagement**

* Client makes a commitment to change
* Reports behavioral change outside sessions
* Develops tolerance for deeper and more intense affect in sessions
* Shows capacity to "do the work" of therapy

These indicators suggest that a secure therapeutic attachment is forming.

### The main goal of the working phase is to develop a secure attachment in which clients are able to meet their needs consistently through security-based

**Comprehension Notes: Comprehensive Treatment of Attachment Disturbances**

**Goals of Working Phase:**
- Develop a secure attachment with clients
- Reduce hyperactivated patients' need for reassurance
- Reduce deactivated patients' tendency to cut off emotional experience
- Shift from insecure to secure attachment style

**Core Feature:**
- Clients rely on security-based strategies to regulate affect and meet interpersonal needs
- Secure attachment to therapist provides corrective emotional experience

**Termination Phase:**
- Major separation, reactivation of old dysfunctional behaviors expected
- Therapists should be aware of hyperactivating and deactivating strategies during termination

**Consensus Model:**
- Integrates many principles of good attachment treatment
- Valuable contributions from intersubjective and metacognitive fields not explicitly included

**Three Pillars of Attachment Treatment:**
- Detailed in the following chapters
- Combines important published material and clinical experience
- Efficient at creating comprehensive attachment repair

### CHAPTER 7 Introduction to the Three Pillars of Comprehensive Attachment Treatment

**Chapter 7: Three Pillars of Comprehensive Attachment Treatment**

**Introduction:**

- Approximately half of mental health seekers present with relational disturbances instead of psychiatric conditions.
- Understanding relational disturbance and its subtypes is crucial due to its significant impact on psychotherapy.

**Three Types of Relational Disturbance:**

1. **Attachment Disturbance:**
   - Develops between 12-20 months, forming internal working models (IWM) and attachment patterns.
   - Two memory systems develop: behavioral and narrative.
   - Behavioral memory system is present from birth, narrative memory begins at 18-24 months.
   - Attachment disturbance in adults expressed primarily as reenactments in relationships, including transference.
   - Interpretation of transference reenactments may not lead to insight due to the developmental timing of memory systems.

2. **Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT):**
   - Develops between third and fourth year of life.
   - Characterized by the maturation of narrative memory, complex emotional ideas, stable beliefs, schemas, wishes, needs, fantasies, and defenses.
   - A second layer of relational representation independent of attachment representation.

3. **Object Relations:**
   - Develops during late childhood and adolescence.
   - Involves the development of a sense of self and others as distinct entities with internal thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
   - Object relations are organized into mental structures called "internalized objects."

**Conclusion:**

- Comprehensive attachment treatment addresses all three types of relational disturbance.
- Understanding the developmental stages and memory systems associated with each type is essential for effective treatment.

### The CCRT is a relatively fixed and repeating pattern of a person’s relational expectations and experiences. Based on a patient’s account of his or her

**CCRT (Cycle of Relational Patterns and Transactions)**

- A relatively fixed and repeating pattern of relational expectations and experiences based on past and present relationships
- Consists of wishes, needs, intentions (W), responses from others (RO), and responses from self (RS)
- Formed during childhood due to functioning narrative memory
- More complex and diverse than attachment maps
- Identification and conscious recognition of dysfunctional CCRT patterns can contribute to diminishing their effect

**CCRT Formulation Example:**

- You go into relationships wanting to be appreciated for who you are (W)
- Others commonly respond by never satisfying your needs (RO)
- You then feel not seen, discouraged, and depressed (RS)

**CCRT vs Attachment Maps**

- CCRT maps are more complex and diverse than attachment maps
- CCRTs can be present whether or not a person has attachment disturbance
- Problematic and clinically significant CCRTs can occur in securely attached individuals

**Trauma Bonding**

- Occurs in relationships with significant power differential and intermittent experiences of fright and caring behavior
- Can develop in childhood or adulthood
- Reflects a reactivation of early attachment disturbance, acquired in adulthood, or both
- Shows a pattern of relational disturbance similar to fearful (disorganized) or anxious-preoccupied attachment

**Determining Underlying Causes of Relational Disturbance**

- Accurate determination of underlying causes is essential before treatment
- Assess attachment type using AAI or other measures
- Collect history of relational episodes to develop a CCRT formulation
- Determine if trauma bonding is present
- Decide together whether the relational disturbance is related primarily to attachment, CCRT, or trauma
- Develop a specific treatment plan based on determination

**Treatment Focus**

- If secure attachment with problematic CCRTs or trauma bonding: focus on latter issues
- Significant insecure attachment of one type or another and/or problematic CCRTs or trauma bonding: initially focus on attachment patterns
- Mild-to-moderate anxious or dismissing attachment with CCRT conflict or trauma bonding: clinical judgment needed as to which issue to address first based on interference with relationships

**Resources for Treatment**

- Luborsky, 1984; Strupp and Binder, 1984; Luborsky and Critt-Christoph, 1998; Book, 1998 (CCRT treatment)
- J. G. Allen, 2001; Hassan, 2000, 2009; Landenburger, 1989; van der Kolk, 1989 (Trauma bonding treatment)

### Treating Attachment Disturbance: The Three Pillars

**Treating Attachment Disturbance: The Three Pillars**

* Developed over last 20 years for adult attachment disturbances
* Based on Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) protocol, metacognitive skills development, and collaborative behavior in treatment

**The First Pillar: The Ideal Parent Figure Protocol**

* Focuses on developing new, positive internal representations of attachment
* Assumptions:
  + Attachment behavior develops after 12-20 months, with representations peaking around 18 months
  + Representation of attachment, not behavior, is the main focus for treatment intervention
  + Interpreting dysfunctional attachment patterns does not lead to change
  + Direct introduction of positive attachment imagery creates new, positive attachment map
* Utilizes mental imagery as an efficient way to develop new internal representations

**Background and Core Assumptions**

* Attachment behavior starts in first weeks of life, but specific patterns and underlying representations develop between 12-20 months
* Representation of attachment is the main focus for treatment intervention
* Interpreting dysfunctional attachment patterns does not lead to change
* Direct introduction of positive attachment imagery creates new, positive attachment map

**The Second Pillar: Fostering Metacognitive Skills**

* Addresses limitations in metacognitive capacity
* Helps patients understand their thoughts and emotions related to attachment

**The Third Pillar: Promoting Collaborative Behavior in the Treatment Relationship**

* Encourages nonverbal and verbal collaboration between patient and therapist
* Enhances therapeutic alliance and treatment effectiveness

**Mutually Enhancing Interrelationship of the Three Pillars**

* Each pillar benefits its particular domain of focus
* The application of each one reinforces and enhances the others

### The Five Primary Conditions That Promote Secure Attachment

**Five Primary Conditions That Promote Secure Attachment**

1. **A Sense of Felt Safety:**
   - Child experience: Consistent and reliable protection from danger and threat.
   - Parental behavior: Providing consistent and reliable protection.
   - Benefits: Emotion regulation, key self-functioning capacities.

2. **A Sense of Being Seen and Known:**
   - Child experience: Consistently sensing that parents see and understand them.
   - Parental behavior: Consistent, reliable, and accurate attunement to the child.
   - Benefits: Self-esteem, metacognitive development, key self-functioning capacities.

3. **Experience of Felt Comfort:**
   - Child experience: Receiving consistent, reliable, and timely soothing and reassurance.
   - Parental behavior: Providing consistent, reliable, and timely comfort.
   - Benefits: Key self-functioning capacities.

4. **A Sense of Being Valued:**
   - Child experience: Feeling consistently valued by parents.
   - Parental behavior: Consistent, reliable, and clear expressed delight in the child.
   - Benefits: Self-development, metacognitive development, key self-functioning capacities.

5. **A Sense of Support for Being and Becoming One's Unique, Best Self:**
   - Child experience: Receiving consistent, reliable, unconditional support and encouragement for exploration.
   - Parental behavior: Providing consistent, reliable, unconditional support and encouragement.
   - Benefits: Self-development, metacognitive development, key self-functioning capacities.

**General Factors:**
- Consistency and reliability are common to all parental behavior categories.
- Parental presence and interest are also important factors.

**Benefits of Secure Attachment:**
- Soothing and reassurance: Emotion regulation.
- Attunement and expressed delight: Self-esteem, metacognitive development.
- Attunement and support for exploration: Self-development, metacognitive development.
- Foundation of protection: Supports all self-functions.

### 1. Felt Safety/Protection

**Bowlby's Attachment Theory:**

* Primary function of attachment: protection of species from predators
* Humans: maternal protectiveness leads to felt sense of safety in world and relationship with mother
* Failure of protection can lead to devastating ruptures, harder to heal than abuse memories
* Parental protectiveness not always present or effective
* Secure base provides protection but not overprotection
* IPF protocol introduces protective ideal parent figures for attachment repair

**Bowlby's Attachment Theory (continued):**

* Protection failures lead to insecure attachment patterns
* Therapist co-creates ideal parent figures using IPF protocol
* Ideal parents deeply protective, responsive when harm occurs
* Positive opposites of parents with protection failures.

### 2. Feeling Seen and Known/Attunement

**Attunement and Secure Attachment**

- Attuned parents are carefully attuned to their child's behavior, inner state, and developmental range
- Demonstrate immediate responsiveness, contingent matching, and voice recognition of emotions, needs, motivations, and ideas
- Support present capacities while introducing challenges for optimal development
- Help children find the right skill-to-challenge ratio for optimal functioning and development
- Example: Developmentally attuned parents understand potty training developmental stages and respond accordingly
- Non-attuned parents may engage in power struggles, humiliation, or personal failure experiences, limiting secure attachment formation

**Components of Attunement**

- **Immediate behavior:** Parent's response to the child's current actions
- **Inner state of mind:** Understanding and responding to the child's emotions and thoughts
- **Developmental range:** Adjusting parenting style based on the child's developmental stage

**Effects of Attunement**

- Feeling deeply known and seen by the parent
- Enables attachment repair for adults lacking secure childhood experiences
- Incorporation of consistent attunement and contingent responsiveness into a positive map of secure attachment through imagined ideal parent figures.

### 3. Felt Comfort/Soothing and Reassurance In addition to promoting attachment security, consistent parental soothing and reassurance contributes over t

**Felt Comfort and Soothing**

- Contributes to the development of internal affect regulation (Marian Tolpin, 1971)
- Results from cumulative internalization of repeated soothing behavior by parents
- Parental response includes physical comfort, emotional soothing, and verbal reassurance
- Child experiences "felt comfort" when parent responds
- Repeated experience leads to internal representation of soothing response
- As child develops representational thinking, they can evoke internal representation for self-soothing

**Impact on Insecure Attachment**

- Adult patients with insecure attachment show clinically significant affect-regulation deficits
- Emotion repair and development is done through ideal parent figures (IPF)
- IPF provide physical comfort, emotional soothing, and verbal reassurance during emotional upset
- Affect-regulatory goal: Incorporation into new positive map of secure attachment as soothing-related representations.

**Key Concepts:**

- Felt comfort
- Internal affect regulation
- Cumulative internalization
- Ideal parent figures (IPF)
- Emotion repair and development
- Representation thinking
- Soothing-related representations.

### 4. Feeling Valued/Expressed Delight Consistently expressed delight by parents about and to the child not only promotes secure attachment but is also t

**Self-Esteem Development**

- Defined as linking positive affect states to self-representation (Sander, 1975)
- Narcissistically vulnerable adults failed to link positive affect states directly to their self-representation during childhood
- Healthy self-esteem: backdrop of positive feeling when evoking sense of self in everyday life
- Parents' expressed delight is foundation for healthy self-esteem development
- **Kohut's assertions:** every child needs reinforcement of being seen as "gleam in mother's eye"
- Parents who raise children with healthiest self-esteem: express joy about child's actions and being
- Repeated expressions of joy and delight by parents becomes developmental bridge for linking deeply positive emotional states to child's self-representation
- Modern Western culture parents often focused on job of parenting over joy, preoccupied with what child does rather than who they are
- **IPF method:** supports self-esteem development through ideal parent figures expressing utter joy or delight about child's behavior and being.

### 5. Felt Support for Best Self/Unconditional Support and Encouragement Parents of secure children who develop a strong, autonomous, and complex sense o

**Attachment-Based Imagery for Secure Self-Development**

* Parents of secure children encourage exploration and self-development by providing unconditional support and encouragement.
* Winnicott emphasized the importance of free play and exploration in self-development.
* Secure attachment is essential for healthy self-development, especially for those with anxious-preoccupied or disorganized attachment patterns.
* Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) imagery is used to provide support and encouragement for self-exploration and play.

**Early Stages of Treatment**

* Focus on attachment-promoting conditions: safety/protection, being seen and known/attunement, felt comfort/soothing, and feeling valued/expressed delight.
* IPF imagery serves as a secure base for exploration.
* Goal: foster the development of a strong, autonomous sense of self (the "best self").

**Middle to Late Stages of Treatment**

* Emphasis shifts from secure-base-promoting imagery to exploration-in-the-context-of-secure-base imagery.
* Support for internal and external explorations.
* Goal: further develop a strong, autonomous sense of self.
* Introduction of developmental sequence imagery protocols to promote self-definition, self-organization, self-agency, self-esteem, self-in-relation-to-others, and self in expanded contexts.
* Patient creates a coherent life narrative about themselves.

**Late Stages of Treatment**

* Introduction of imagery of secure intimacy with a partner.
* Goal: establish a positive map for secure intimacy as a reference point for future relationships.

**Overall Purpose**

* Utilize attachment-based imagery to efficiently foster the development of a new, unified positive internal working model (IWM) of secure attachment.
* As the patient uses the new, secure map as their basis of operation in everyday life, outdated insecure maps are eclipsed and reinforced by positive relational experiences.
* Effective treatment brings offline deactivated attachment systems and normalizes hyperactivated attachment systems.

### THE SECOND PILLAR: FOSTERING A RANGE OF METACOGNITIVE SKILLS

**The Second Pillar: Fostering a Range of Metacognitive Skills**

- Research using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) shows that secure attachment is associated with high coherence of discourse and underlying mind, while insecure attachment is linked to low coherence. (Main, 1984)
- Coherence on AAI scales is strongly correlated with metacognitive capacity, or the ability to be aware of one's own and others' minds and mental activities. (Main et al., 2002)
- Individuals who score high on the AAI Metacognitive Processes scale are likely to have secure attachment patterns. (Main et al., 2002)
- Peter Fonagy, Anthony Bateman, and others at the London School discovered that enhancing metacognitive capacity through specific interventions contributes to the development of high coherence and secure attachment in patients with clinically significant attachment disturbances. (Fonagy et al., 1998)
- Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) was developed based on this finding, focusing on fostering curiosity about states of mind in self and others. (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004)
- MBT involves a process of joint awareness where the patient's mental states are explored, reducing reliance on content and encouraging multiple perspectives. (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004)
- A therapist adopts a "mentalizing stance" to help patients develop metacognitive skills by consistently questioning why individuals say or behave in certain ways. (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004)
- Mentalization entails exploring a mind by a mind and leads to the development of general metacognitive capacity in the patient. (Fonagy et al., 1998)
- The Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) assesses reflective capacity, which is the psychological processes underlying the ability to mentalize. (Fonagy et al., 1998)
- MBT significantly contributes to the development of reflective function, enabling patients to become more aware of their immediate mental states, label and understand affective and cognitive states, identify limitations of knowledge, contextualize states of mind, and mentalize about others' states of mind and transference in therapy. (Fonagy et al., 1998)
- The process of mentalizing through MBT can lead to the development of new positive representations for intimate relationships by enabling patients to create mental representations of themselves and their therapists. (Fonagy et al., 2002)

### The London group’s findings that mentalization-based methods contribute to reflective capacity, to increasing coherence of mind, and ultimately to ear

**London Group Findings:**

- Mentalization-based methods contribute to reflective capacity, coherence of mind, and earned security.
- Metacognitive function is associated with coherence of mind and attachment security.
- Essential component of attachment-based treatment: developing metacognitive, reflective capacity.

**Limitations of London Approach:**

- Assumes reflective capacity is a unitary construct.
- All types of metacognition result from a single reflective function process.

**Rome School Findings:**

- Specific metacognitive deficits associated with specific diagnostic conditions.
- Metacognitive mastery, differentiation, and integration capacities vary between disorders.
- Condition-specific approach: identify and develop deficient metacognitive abilities for each patient.

**Shared Beliefs:**

- Specific metacognitive skills are remarkably absent in patients of specific diagnostic groups.
- Consistent focus on metacognition improves general reflective capacity and functioning.

**Differences between Approaches:**

- London: general approach, fosters development of general reflective capacity.
- Rome: condition-specific approach, identifies and develops deficient metacognitive abilities for each patient.

**Combined Approach:**

- Identify specific metacognitive abilities lacking in a patient.
- Foster the development of those specific abilities while supporting general reflective capacity.

**Expanded Model of Cognitive Development:**

- Beyond formal operational thinking (London approach).
- 12 stages of cognitive development, including postformal stages.
- Fosters higher-level metacognitive skills for overall mental health.

**Metacognitive Skills Relevant to Attachment-Based Psychotherapy:**

- Strengthen existing skills and promote the development of advanced skills.
- London and Rome groups' identified skills plus more advanced skills.

**Categories of Metacognitive Potentials:**

- Basic: fundamental metacognitive abilities.
- Intermediate: metacognitive abilities that build on basic skills.
- Advanced: metacognitive abilities representative of higher levels of cognitive development.

### Basic metacognitive skills 1. Awareness of the state of mind of self or other 2. Monitoring the accuracy of state of mind 3. Awareness of one’s own in

**Metacognitive Skills**

_Basic Metacognitive Skills_
- Awareness of state of mind (own or others)
  * Monitoring accuracy
  * Influence on behavior
- Regulation of state of mind
- Awareness of action plans and goal-directedness
- Meaning-making

_Intermediate Metacognitive Skills_
- Recognition of past influences
- Relativity of states of mind
- Seeing beyond information given
- Optimizing action plans
- Sensitivity to contextual effects
- Perspective-taking

_Advanced Metacognitive Skills_
- Wider, supersystemic perspective
- Awareness of past/present, self/other orientations
- Degree of organization or coherence of mind
- Recognition of interdependence
- Articulating ultimate concerns
- Direct awareness of wider reality
- Highest-order metacognitive skills (spacious freedom, wisdom)

**Assumptions and Goals of Treatment**
- Increase patient's facility with overall mentalizing and various metacognitive skills
- Achieve earned security and high coherence on Attachment Anxiety Inventory (AAI)
- Advancement to and stabilization of higher levels of adult cognitive development
- Fostering the widest possible range of metacognitive skills is a second pillar of comprehensive approach to treating attachment disturbance.

### THE THIRD PILLAR: FOSTERING COLLABORATIVE NONVERBAL AND VERBAL BEHAVIOR

**The Third Pillar: Fostering Collaborative Behavior, Nonverbal Communication, and Verbal Communication**

* Human species is uniquely cooperative and collaborative in three ways: cooperative shared behavior, nonverbal communication, and verbal communication (Gilbert, 1989; Tomasello, 2009)
* Securely attached infants exhibit collaborative nonverbal and verbal communication with caregivers (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014; Tomasello, 2010)
* Infants in insecure attachment systems deactivate their natural tendencies toward collaborativeness due to caregiving inadequacies (unresponsiveness, inconsistency, overinvolvement, rejection, etc.)
* Collaborative partnership is crucial for patients with insecure attachment, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, or psychotic disorders (Liotti, 2005)

**Fostering Collaborativeness: Therapist's Stance and Interventions**

* Attachment-based therapists view therapy as a mutually regulated process of collaboration
* Establishing a collaborative treatment frame at the onset of therapy (clear understanding of expectations for both patient and therapist)
* Confronting noncollaborative behaviors from either party (patient or therapist)
* Maintaining shared, collaborative responsibility

**Behavior: Collaborative Treatment Frame and Nonverbal Communication**

* Developing a collaboratively established treatment frame
* Confronting noncollaborative behaviors that interfere with therapy
* Careful observation and identification of mismatches in nonverbal communication
* Increasing nonverbal matching between patient and therapist
* Verbally bringing the patient's attention to impaired nonverbal patterns

**Verbal Communication: Coherent, Cooperative Discourse**

* Poor verbal collaborativeness in adults with insecure attachment often manifests through deviations from Grice's maxims of coherent, cooperative discourse
* Insecure preoccupied adults make irrelevant comments, wander off topic, lose track of the point, and use passive, vague, or jargon expressions
* Insecure dismissing adults do not express important points in sufficient detail and depth
* Pointing out patterns of noncollaborative verbal behavior and exploring their antecedent states of mind
* Developing better metacognitive awareness of these patterns and their precipitants
* Replacing noncollaborative verbalization with more collaborative expressions

**Overall Outcome: Consistently Collaborative Dialogue and Enhanced Verbalization Capacity**

* More consistently collaborative dialogue based on coherent, cooperative verbal expression throughout treatment
* Enhancement of collaborative verbalization capacity and behavior outside of therapy.

### The Interdependence of the Three Pillars of Treatment

**Three Pillars of Treatment: Attachment, Metacognitive Development, and Collaborativeness**

* The methods for fostering collaborativeness in therapy are collaborative by nature and enhance metacognitive development
* The attachment system, peer-collaborative behavioral system, and metacognitive system are interdependent in treatment
* Six interrelationships between the three pillars:

**Attachment Imagery Promotes Metacognitive Development**

* Engaging with ideal parent figure imagery promotes metacognitive awareness
* Represents healthy attachment, builds metacognitive awareness, and experiences metacognitive mastery

**Metacognitive Development Promotes Attachment**

* Teaches patients to be aware of their states of mind and attachment patterns
* Provides windows into the therapist's state of mind
* Supports accurate and realistic internal representations of attachment figures

**Collaborativeness Promotes Metacognitive Development**

* Collaborative goal of therapy development of metacognitive skills
* Therapist models and emphasizes collaboration
* Patient becomes more aware of noncollaborative behaviors and develops greater collaborative behavior

**Metacognitive Development Promotes Collaborativeness**

* Calling attention to noncollaborative treatment-frame behavior and nonverbal/verbal behaviors promotes metacognitive awareness
* Patient is more likely to develop greater collaborative behavior

**Collaborativeness Promotes Attachment**

* Mutually respectful, collaborative relationship promotes positive, healthy Internal Working Model (IWM) or attachment map
* Collaborative therapy relationship and Ideal Parent Figure protocol build positive attachment representations

**Attachment Imagery Promotes Collaborativeness**

* Patients develop positive attachment imagery in the Ideal Parent Figure protocol
* Builds an experience of a mutually collaborative relationship with ideal parent figures
* Enhances overall collaborativeness and adds collaborative elements to the developing internal working model of attachment.

### The Benefits of Three Pillars Treatment

**Three Pillars Treatment:** A therapeutic approach for patients with attachment disturbances that includes:

1. **Repeated engagement with ideal parent figure imagery:**
   - Formation of new, positive stable internal working models for healthy adult attachment

2. **Promoting a wide range of metacognitive skills:**
   - Manifestation of a range of metacognitive skills, including:
     * Higher-order metacognitive skills utilized in everyday life
     - Achievement of some level of postformal cognitive development
   - No longer meeting diagnostic criteria for a personality or dissociative disorder

3. **Fostering behavioral, nonverbal, and verbal collaborativeness:**
   - Manifestation of healthy behavioral, nonverbal, and verbal collaborative behaviors
   - Achievement of high coherence of discourse and mind on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)
   - Capacity for secure intimacy in adulthood

**Primary Indicators of Successful Attachment-Based Treatment:**

- Formation of new, positive stable internal working models for healthy adult attachment
- Manifestation of a range of metacognitive skills
- Achievement of some level of postformal cognitive development
- Manifestation of healthy behavioral, nonverbal, and verbal collaborative behaviors
- Achievement of high coherence of discourse and mind on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)
- No longer meeting diagnostic criteria for a personality or dissociative disorder
- Capacity for secure intimacy in adulthood

### CHAPTER 8 The First Pillar The Ideal Parent Figure Protocol Overview: Positive Remapping

**Chapter 8: The First Pillar**

**Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Protocol Overview:**

- Therapist facilitates development of a positive, stable inner working model of attachment relationships.
- Uses imagery to remap attachment representations from insecure to secure.
- Patient engages with imagery of positive attachment figures and secure experiences.
- Repetition and elaboration establish new internal model of secure attachment.

**Skillful Use:**

1. Familiarity with the tool.
2. Recognizing patient's unique patterns and needs.
3. Understanding caretaking qualities that promote secure attachment.

**IPF vs Traditional Attachment-Based Treatments:**

- Primary agent of change is patient's relationship with imagined attachment figures.
- Applied in therapeutic relationship context.
- Therapist embodies qualities that promote secure attachment.

**Qualities That Promote Secure Attachment:**

1. Physical presence, reliability, consistency, and interest.
2. Protection when patient is at risk.
3. Accurate attunement to behavior, state, developmental level.
4. Soothing and reassuring.
5. Expressing delight or positive regard.
6. Support for inner and outer exploration.

**Therapist's Role in IPF Protocol:**

- Present, reliable, consistent, and interested.
- Protective when needed.
- Attuned to patient's experience.
- Soothing and reassuring.
- Expresses delight in positive experiences.
- Embodies support for exploration.

**Incorporating Attachment-Promoting Qualities:**

- Therapist recognizes, mirrors, and enhances qualities that promote secure attachment as they appear in patient's imagery.
- Draws from patient's unique attachment history to suggest specific attachment-promoting qualities if they do not appear spontaneously.

**IPF Process:**

- No preestablished scripts.
- Effective when therapist understands underlying principles and responds freshly during each session with a particular patient.

### The Foundational Protocol SETTING THE THERAPEUTIC GROUND

**IPF Protocol: Setting the Therapeutic Ground**

* The therapist helps the patient establish a calm, relaxed, inwardly focused state of awareness
* Focusing on body experience enhances attachment formation during critical period (12-20 months)
* Establishing this state increases vividness of imagery and decreases distractions

**Establishing a Calm, Relaxed State**

* Patient settles comfortably into chair, letting the body relax
* Therapist guides patient to focus on body sensations and feelings
* Additional guidance may be necessary for anxious or distracted patients
* Dissociative patients may enter preparatory state easily

**Deepening the Inwardly Focused State**

* Charcot's method: eyes open during inhalation, close during exhalation
* Therapist makes supportive comments and enhances focus on calming and relaxation
* Patient becomes more aware of exhalations and releases tension with each exhale
* Final step: brief body scan to find most comfortable area and focus on it

**Preparing the Patient for Subsequent Imagery Work**

* Therapist is free to choose methods based on understanding of preparatory phase principles.

### FACILITATING THE CREATION OF IDEAL PARENT FIGURE IMAGERY

**Facilitating the Creation of Ideal Parent Figure Imagery**

* Patients engage with self-generated, affect-rich imagery of being a child in the presence of positive attachment figures
* Therapist sets up conditions to evoke child experience and ideal parent figure imagery
* Evoke child experience: patients imagine themselves as young children and feel the experience
* Prompt for ideal parent figure imagery: patients create fictional parents who promote secure attachment
* Use "imagine" instead of "visualize" to allow multi-sensory experiences
* Inquire about patient's imagery and assess adequacy

**Setting up the Conditions**

* Evoke child experience:
  * Patients imagine themselves as young children
  * Indicate when child experience is evoked
* Prompt for ideal parent figure imagery:
  * Patients create ideal parents, not actual or known figures
  * Parents have qualities that help patient feel safe and secure
  * Use "imagine" instead of "visualize"

**Assessing the Adequacy of Imagery**

* Ideal imagery:
  * Multisensory experience of two parent figures
  * Not actual or known parents
  * Parents behave in attachment-promoting ways
* Adequate imagery:
  * At least one parent figure not actual or known
  * Contact through some sensory modality
  * Absence of harmful behaviors

**Common Challenges**

* If no parent figures are imagined, focus on evoking the imagery and encouraging creativity
* If patient indicates actual parents, provide guidance for letting go and creating fictional ideal parents
* Additional prompting and correction may be needed for more severe attachment disorders.

### CLINICAL VIGNETTES

**IDEAL PARENT FIGURE THERAPY: CLINICAL VIGNETTES**

* Illustrative introduction to ways adequate or better ideal parent figure imagery may manifest during early sessions
* Patients' experiences and therapist responses for supporting and enhancing positive remapping process

**First Session:**

* Patient feels cared for and loved by imagined parents
* Therapist reinforces focus on parents' ways of being
* Patient experiences calmness, security, proximity-seeking, and fun with parents

**Third Session:**

* Patient describes imagined parents as kind, attentive, close by, caring, nurturing, and playful
* Therapist reinforces focus on parents' ways of being rather than actions
* Patient experiences happiness, energy, and security

**Fifth Session:**

* Patient feels comforted by imagined parents' demeanor, caring, and nurturing qualities
* Therapist reinforces focus on parents' interest in patient's experience
* Patient experiences happiness, energy, and positive self-esteem

**Common Themes:**

* Therapist emphasizes the importance of focusing on parents' ways of being rather than actions
* Patients describe imagined parents as caring, nurturing, attentive, and interested in their experience
* Patients experience positive emotions (calmness, happiness, energy) and security when interacting with imagined parents
* Therapist reinforces focus on patients' inner experiences and feelings to anchor positive states in the body.

### As noted in the commentaries about the above two vignettes, the therapist’s language oriented the patient’s focus to the parent figures’ ways of being

**Therapy Sessions Focusing on Parent Figures' Ways of Being**

* Therapist's language in sessions orients patient's focus to parent figures' ways of being, not just what they do
* Instrumental or caretaking behaviors are common for patients to report and not inherently problematic
* Therapist validates positive caretaking actions and refocuses attention on the more important quality from which it comes

**Example of Reporting Instrumental Love**

* Patient reports parent figures helping with tasks and making things
* Therapist acknowledges and validates actions while emphasizing positive qualities of being

**Establishing Ideal Parent Figure Imagery in IPF Sessions**

* Patients with insecure attachment may find it challenging to establish clear imagery
* Therapist provides support by expressing belief in patient's ability to create imagery and affirming importance of their preferences
* Shaping parent figure imagery to emphasize child's preferences, interests, and needs promotes secure attachment

**Patient with Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment (E2)**

* Therapist anticipates patient may focus more on parent figures' states and needs than her own
* Shaping parent figure imagery to emphasize child's preferences and interests can help balance attention
* Spontaneous reporting of parents being reassuring is beneficial, and therapist can further shape IPF imagery with positive opposites of problematic qualities in actual parents.

### The therapist pointed the patient’s attention to her own state of mind and then mirrored her positive states and suggested a felt sense of security (“

**Principles and Practices for Framing and Responding to Patients' Experiences in Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Sessions**

**General Guiding Principles:**

- Therapist acknowledges patient's current state of mind and emotions.
- Therapist mirrors positive states and validates experiences.
- Therapist shapes imagery to be accepting, patient, protective, and attuned.
- Validation of the primacy of the patient's own experience and learning.
- Use of gentle push towards realizing developmental potential.
- Importance of self-validation in the process.

**Interaction between Patient and Therapist:**

1. **Patient expresses lack of security:** The therapist recognizes the patient's doubt and incorporates it into the imagery process, indicating that parent figures are attuned to the patient's internal state.
2. **Therapist suggests feeling secure:** Although the patient does not feel secure at that moment, this suggestion serves as a test and an expression of confidence in her developmental potential.
3. **Patient asserts own experience:** The patient's willingness to assert her own experience against the therapist's suggestion is an important self-validation signifying the possibility of security.

**Variability in Patients' Responses:**

- Wide range of attachment insecurity types and manifestations.
- Variability in patients' responses to IPF sessions, from vivid and detailed imagery to imagining harmful or no parent figures.

**Addressing Challenges:**

- Particular challenges addressed later in the chapter.
- Considerations for each insecure attachment subtype addressed in Chapters 11, 12, and 13.

### GENERAL CONTEXT PRINCIPLES

**Int Intensive Parenting Formula (IPF) Method**

- Based on patient's active engagement with ideal parent figure imagery
- Therapist's way of being facilitates imagery work and attachment repair
- Good-enough therapist embodies: physical presence, consistency, reliability, interest
- Foundation for "five behavioral pillars" promoting secure attachment

**Therapist's Role in IPF Process**

- Helps patient establish calm, relaxed state
- Welcomes and accepts whatever arises during protocol
- Responds attentively to patient's moment-to-moment experience
- Expresses delight in patient's reports of ideal parent figures
- Encourages exploration of inner and outer world
- Dedicated to protecting patient's wellbeing

**Patient's Ideal Parent Figure Imagery**

- Frame for developing attachment security
- Patient imagines parents who provide safety and security
- Patient accesses unique needs, projecting qualities into imagined parents
- Foundation based on patient's deepest knowing of what was missing during childhood

**IPF Process**

- Therapist asks patient to imagine ideal parents
- Patient accesses own awareness of attachment needs
- Imagined parents have foundation in patient's unique needs
- Promotes attachment repair through relational experience.

### SHAPE THE PATIENT’S IMAGERY AND EXPERIENCE

**Attachment-Focused Imagery Protocol**

* Therapist shapes patient's imagery and experience towards attachment security
* Patient describes parent figures and experiences with them
* Therapist points attention to attachment-promoting qualities
	+ Notice ways they're being with you
	+ Notice how they're promoting security
	+ Reinforces creative and generative process
* Mirror and enhance patient's descriptions of attachment-promoting qualities
	+ Use patient's words and phrases
	+ Build upon literal expressions
	+ Validate and strengthen confidence in imagery and process
* Effective mirroring contributes to power of imagery to create new, positive attachment representations
* Therapist's marked expressivity reproduces beneficial developmental circumstance

**Patient's Experience**

* Deeply felt experience of imagined parent figures
* Focus on ways they promote attachment security
* Stay engaged with the imagery and experience

**Therapist's Role**

* Frequently ask patient to describe parent figures and experiences
* Point attention towards attachment-promoting qualities
	+ Notice how they're being with you
	+ Reinforce creative and generative process
* Mirror and enhance patient's descriptions of attachment-promoting qualities
	+ Use patient's words and phrases
	+ Build upon literal expressions
	+ Validate and strengthen confidence in imagery and process
* Effective mirroring contributes to power of imagery to create new, positive attachment representations
* Marked expressivity reproduces beneficial developmental circumstance.

### SUGGEST ATTACHMENT-PROMOTING QUALITIES IN THE IMAGINED PARENT FIGURES

**Attachment-Promoting Qualities in Imagined Parent Figures**

- Therapist encourages patients to imagine ideal parent figures with attachment-promoting qualities
- Patients may struggle to generate these qualities, so therapist provides suggestions
- Suggestions include:
  * Correcting focus on parent figures' doing and highlighting underlying qualities of being
  * Introducing general principles of secure attachment formation
  * Introducing positive opposites of problematic aspects of patients' experiences with actual parents

**Correcting for Instrumental Caretaking**

- Patients may describe parent figures engaging in instrumental actions, but these actions don't necessarily promote attachment security
- Therapist mirrors and enhances any attachment-promoting qualities present in the patient's imagery
- Suggestions include:
  * Pointing attention to positive qualities of being underlying the action
  * Linking the action, affective state, and relationship to provide mirroring and shaping

**Examples of Therapist Interventions**

Patient: Mother is making dinner for me.
- Therapist mirrors action and suggests attachment-promoting qualities of being: happy, there with patient, making what patient enjoys

Patient: Mother is brushing my hair.
- Therapist mirrors action and suggests attachment-promoting qualities of being: present, soothing, loving, interested, caring

### Suggest that the imagined parent figures have qualities that are known in general to support secure attachment. In response to particular attachment-p

**Imagined Parent Figures: Qualities to Support Secure Attachment**

**General Factors**
- *PHYSICAL PRESENCE*
  - Genuinely accessible and available
  - Consistently present when needed
  - Special relationship with reliable availability

- *CONSISTENCY*

### Information about a patient’s early experiences with parents can be obtained in several ways. The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & M

**Obtaining Information about a Patient's Early Parental Experiences**

* The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) was developed to obtain attachment status information.
* Conducted by trained therapists or referred to qualified administrators.
* Yields adjectives describing patient's relationships with mothers and fathers during early childhood.
* Negative qualities indicate parental relationship issues, positive opposites guide IPF sessions.

**AAI Transcript and Scoring**

* Reveals nature of parental relationships and contributing qualities.
* Valuable for therapists in shaping imagined parent figures.
* Positive opposites of negative adjectives:
  * Relationship with mother: Calm, Present, Accepting, Safe, Warm, Attuned caretaking, Clear, Predictable, Relaxed, and Attuned playfulness.
  * Relationship with father: Responsible, Calm, Present, Warm, Attuned caretaking, Clear, Predictable, Relaxed, and Attuned playfulness.

**IPF Sessions with Positive Opposites**

* Therapist suggests qualities of imagined parent figures based on positive opposites.
* Calm, Present, Accepting, Safe, Warm, Attuned caretaking, Clear, Predictable, Relaxed, and Attuned playfulness.
* Patients may accept suggestions or have difficulty recognizing positive opposite qualities.
* Therapist's repetition supports appearance and stability in patient's imagery.

**Alternative Method: Exploring Parental Relationships during Initial Evaluation**

* If AAI transcript unavailable, explore parental relationships in detail during history-taking.
* Obtain as much detail as possible about parents' typical ways of being and patient's experiences.
* Transform negative feelings into positive opposites for IPF sessions.

**Single Parent or Caregiver Household**

* Focus on patient's experience with single parent.
* Probe for feelings related to absence of other parent.
* Transform negative feelings into positive opposites for ideal father figure.

### CONTEXTUALIZE THE PATIENT’S EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE IPF FRAME

**Intro:** In Intensive Psychotherapy for Attachment (IPF), the therapist establishes an imagery frame during a session, which becomes the context for the patient's experiences. The therapist responds to the patient based on the parent figures' responses within this frame.

**Maintaining Engagement with Parent Figures:**

* Patients may experience fear or resistance towards parent figures in the imagery frame.
* Therapist responds by acknowledging and validating the patient's feelings, while encouraging the parent figures to help the patient feel safe and supported.
* The goal is for patients to experience the parent figures as beneficially responding to their entire range of experiences.

**Difficulties with Parent Figure Imagery:**

1. **Separation or distance:** Patients may feel physically or emotionally separated from the parent figures.
   * Therapist responds by acknowledging the resistance and encouraging the parent figures to help bridge the gap, allowing the patient to choose how to connect.
2. **Decrease in engagement:** Patients may disengage from the imagery frame and the parent figures.
   * Therapist responds by validating the patient's feelings and encouraging the parent figures to continue showing their love and support, even if it feels too perfect or unreal.
3. **Mistrust or emotional distancing:** Patients may struggle with trusting or emotionally connecting with the parent figures.
   * Therapist responds by acknowledging the patient's mistrust and encouraging the parent figures to show understanding and patience, allowing the patient to gradually build trust.
4. **Uncomfortable affective states:** Patients may experience uncomfortable emotions during the IPF process.
   * Therapist responds by validating the patient's feelings and encouraging the parent figures to help the patient process and manage these emotions in a safe and supportive way.

**Examples of Difficulties and Responses:**

* **Separation or distance:** Patient feels separated from parents by a gauzy, hazy material; therapist encourages parents to help patient connect by pulling aside the material.
* **Decrease in engagement:** Patient experiences parent figures as perfect but unreal; therapist validates the patient's feelings and encourages parents to continue showing love and support.
* **Mistrust or emotional distancing:** Patient does not see any parents; therapist encourages patient to create ideal parents who will help him/her feel safe and supported.
* **Uncomfortable affective states:** Patient feels overwhelmed by parent figures' love and perfection; therapist validates the patient's feelings and encourages parents to continue showing understanding and patience, allowing the patient to gradually accept their love.

### At the beginning of this session, the patient was very engaged with the imagery and the process and generated a vivid, positive interaction with the p

**Imaginal Exposure Therapy (IPF) Session:**

**Engagement and Doubt:**
- Patient was engaged with the IPF process and experienced positive interactions with parent figures.
- Doubt emerged, but patient continued to experience positive affect towards parents.
- Patient withdrew from the frame, expressing it as "faking."
- Therapist maintained the presence of the frame by acknowledging patient's doubt and suggesting that parents understood his perspective.
- Therapist encouraged patient to reengage with the imagery by highlighting how parent figures protected him and supported him in dealing with doubt.

**Reengagement:**
- Patient reengaged with the imagery, experiencing parental reassurance and support.
- However, his reengagement was short-lived as he felt the experiences were still "too perfect" and not real.
- Therapist pointed back to the frame, acknowledging patient's difficulty in accepting it but emphasizing that parent figures recognized this.

**Maintaining Connection:**
- Patient experienced intermittent withdrawal from the IPF frame, expressing mistrust or emotional distancing towards parent figures.
- Therapist acknowledged and validated patient's experiences, suggesting that parent figures were attuned to his needs and would promote trust and safety when he was ready.

**Affective States:**
- During IPF sessions, therapist watches for signs of affective distress in the patient and suggests that parent figures provide soothing and reassurance.
- Therapist is attuned to nonverbal indications of affective shifts and brings them into the imagery frame.
- When patient reports an affective shift, therapist names the state and encourages patient to take in the parental reassurance and support.

### In the following example, the patient reported an affective shift and kept it in the IPF frame herself: Patient: I’m feeling angry at them. I want to 

**Intro:**

- Patient reports feeling angry and seeks validation in IPF frame
- Therapist encourages patient to feel emotions and observes their response from imaginary parents

**Patient's Experience in IPF Frame:**

* Patient feels understood and respected by imaginary parents
* They take her emotions seriously, listen attentively, and don't laugh at her
* They stay with her through her anger
* She feels a sense of respect from them

**Patient's Childhood Experience:**

* Previous experience of mother laughing at her when angry

**When Patient Cannot Respond in IPF Frame:**

* Therapist suggests scene change if patient is unable to respond or receive relief
* New scene appears with ideal parents providing comfort and help

**Effect of Scene Change:**

* Patient feels more calm and open to receiving help from imaginary parents
* Therapist's action reflects attunement, protection, and soothing for the patient.

### SUGGEST CHANGES IN SCENES OR NEW SCENES WITH THE IDEAL PARENT FIGURES

**Ideal Parent Figures (IPF) Sessions: Changes in Scenes or New Scenes**

**Benefits of Changing Scenes with Ideal Parent Figures:**

* Consolidation of positive attachment experiences
* Generalization across various situations and contexts
* Opportunity for patients to project additional attachment-promoting qualities

**Changes within Scenes:**

* Suggesting changes within scenes is best during early IPF sessions
* Open-worded suggestions leave creation of specific parental ways to the patient
* Example: Therapist suggests calm, happy, and fully present parent figures

**Changes of Scenes:**

* After several constructive IPF sessions
* Patient given freedom to project qualities onto new scene's parent figures
* Example: Therapist suggests warm, easygoing, and trustworthy parent figures

**Timing of Suggesting Scene Changes:**

* When patient is having difficulty that parent figures cannot help with
* When patient has been having positive experiences
* Mirror and enhance positive experiences until their attachment-promoting benefits peak
* Intuition-based recognition of scene's purpose fulfillment

**Bring Attention to Experience and Amplify Positive States:**

* Central to IPF method's contribution to attachment repair
* Therapist points patient's attention to experiences of parent figures' attachment-promoting ways
* Example: Therapist suggests comforting, then asks patient to report feelings and amplifies them
* Amplification enhances awareness and differentiation of affects, facilitates introjection of positive attachment representations.

### Phrasings for bringing attention to felt experience. The therapist can be creative with phrasings, guided by the simple goal of pointing the patient’s

**Phrasings for Bringing Attention to Felt Experience**

* Therapist can use creative phrasings to draw patient's attention to positive states elicited by attachment-promoting qualities in ideal parent figures.
* Phrases may include: "How does that feel?", "Notice what happens inside you as they...", "Feel what that’s like.", etc.

**Phrasings for Amplifying Positive States**

* Therapist can use tonally expressive language to enhance the impact of positive states described by the patient.
* Phrases may include: "Really feel what that's like.", "You can feel that [happiness] even more strongly now.", etc.

**Phrasings for Stabilizing and Extending Positive States**

* Once a patient experiences positive states, therapist can use phrases to help them hold onto these feelings.
* Phrases may include: "Focus on that feeling of [safety]", "Notice what it’s like to begin to hold that feeling of [safety] continuously in your awareness.", etc.

**Anchoring Positive States in Body Experience**

* Linking positive states to bodily sensations can help strengthen the attachment repair process.
* Phrases may include: "Notice what that feels like now in the body.", "Feel it in your body.", etc.

During the critical period of attachment formation (12-20 months), identity is primarily based on body experience and memory is behavioral/enacted rather than mental/narrative. Therefore, linking positive states to bodily sensations can facilitate the formation of new attachment representations. The therapist may use attention-directing, amplifying, and stabilizing phrases to help patients connect with their felt experiences and strengthen their attachment bonds.

### INTEGRATE METHODS FOR ENHANCING POSITIVE STATES

**Integrating Positive States in Psychotherapy**

* Enhancing positive states: making patients aware of and familiar with positive feelings towards parent figures
* Elements for enhancing positive states: amplifying, stabilizing, extending, anchoring
* Therapist's role: guiding the patient to integrate these elements

**Interaction Example:**

* Patient expresses feeling comforted by parents
* Therapist guides patient to focus on and feel the sensation of comfort in their body
* Patient becomes more familiar with the feeling, leading to continuous experience
* Scene changes to enhance comfort further

**IPF Session Conclusion:**

* Longer focus on stabilizing, extending, anchoring, and integrating positive states
* Suggesting that patients retain good feelings as scene fades away
* Creating a bridge for smooth transition back to therapy room

**End of Session:**

* Therapist suggests that patients keep positive feelings as scene fades away
* Bridge created for conscious awareness to return smoothly to the therapy room.

### REORIENT THE PATIENT TO THE PRESENT

**IPF (Imaginal Exposure with Parent Figures) Process**

* Reorienting the patient to present time is crucial in IPF process, as some patients may have vivid experiences of being a child during sessions.
* Therapist should allow but not encourage patients to speak about their session experience, addressing any unpleasant feelings or thoughts before ending the session.
* Normalize and reassure patients about negative experiences, acknowledging that doubts and uncertainties are common and indicative of progress in IPF treatment.

**Post-IPF Interaction**

* Patients may doubt the parent figures and IPF frame during sessions.
* Therapist should validate their experience, normalize doubts, and reassure patients that it's a part of the process.

**Signs of Progress in IPF Treatment**

1. **Engagement with attachment-promoting imagery:**
   * Patients with deactivated or imbalanced attachment systems may have difficulty engaging with parent figures.
   * Indications of progress include reports of being with parent figures who show essential qualities like physical presence or interest.
2. **Beneficial effects of positive attachment representations:**
   * Patients begin to experience the benefits of secure attachment, such as feeling soothed and comforted by the parent figures.
3. **Manifestations of an internalized secure base:**
   * Patients start to develop a sense of security within themselves, leading to improved emotional regulation and increased self-confidence.

**Engagement with Attachment-Promoting Imagery**

* Patients show varying degrees and forms of initial engagement with imagined parent figures based on their attachment system's deactivation or imbalance.
* Indications of progress include reports of being with parent figures who display essential qualities like physical presence or interest.
* Engagement is indicated by strong clarity, vividness, close felt connection, and generative responses in the patient's imagery.

### SIGNS OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF POSITIVE ATTACHMENT REPRESENTATIONS

### Another: Patient: They feel confident as parents; they trust themselves. I can ask for something if I need it. They teach me self-reliance. They’re th

**Imaginal Exposure Therapy (IPF): Parent Figure**

- Patients report feeling confident and self-reliant with supportive parent figures in their imagination
- This leads to an inner sense of strength and generosity, not a loss of self
- Examples of patient experiences:
  - Patient reads along with parents during storytelling, shares thoughts and feelings
  - Parent figure validates patient's emotions and boosts self-esteem
  - Calm and stable parent figures promote contentment and clarity in the patient

**Beneficial Effects of IPF:**

- Direct experience: feeling safe, strong, content
- Indirect experience: parents encouraging development of qualities or functions (e.g., curiosity, self-esteem)

**How Indirect Benefits Indicate Benefit:**

- Parent figures' actions and intentions activate underlying developmental processes in the patient
- Continued IPF sessions promote further development and stability of these benefits

**Patient Examples:**

- Patient reads with parents, shares thoughts, feels validated
- Parent figure boosts self-esteem, makes patient feel beautiful and strong
- Calm and stable parent figures promote contentment and clarity in the patient

**Imaginal Parent Figures' Actions:**

- Encouraging development of qualities or functions (curiosity, self-esteem)
- Activating underlying developmental processes
- Promoting further development through continued IPF sessions

**Benefits not Stable:**

- Therapist must engage patient in IPF process over time until benefits are consistently evoked and stable.

### MANIFESTATIONS OF AN INTERNALIZED SECURE BASE

**Internalized Secure Base (ISB)**

- Developed through Intensive Psychotherapy for Families (IPF) process
- Indications of ISB formation in imagery:
  * Consistent, stable attachment-promoting qualities in imagined parent figures
  * Consistent, stable benefits experienced by patient
  * Exploratory behavior by patient

**Exploratory Behavior**

- Patient makes excursions away from parent figures
- Increasing frequency, consistency, duration, and physical extent of such excursions
- Safe-haven seeking: going to caregiver when distressed
- Proximity seeking: preference for physical closeness and affection

**Patient Quotes**

1. "I have space to do what I want to do. I have a safety for exploring. I feel like they trust me."
2. "I feel safe enough. I feel I can express that, physically move to something new. It’s a new feeling in myself, a kind of like courage..."
3. "They know how important that is. They want to support my own connections."
4. "It makes me feel I can venture farther. I’m not stealing myself from them. They think it’s a healthy thing I want to go away."
5. "I can look around more. I’m walking. I don’t have to worry about things."
6. "It feels like the connection has become fully established... Now it's about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now..."

**Significant Change in Experience of Relationship**

- Emergence of ISB: "It feels like a meeting has taken place among the three of us... It feels like a starting point... Now it's about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now..."
- Patient can be themselves with guidance from parent figures
- Parent figures are interested in patient and supportive in new ways.

### Reinforcing the Internalized Secure Base

**Internalized Secure Base and Reinforcing Principles**

* When signs of a secure base are present in patient's imagery, extend, strengthen, and deepen the state using:
  * Mirroring: reflecting back patient's words and feelings
  * Bringing attention to felt experience
  * Amplifying positive states
  * Anchoring positive states in body experience
  * Suggesting new scenes where desired state is present

**Example of Therapy Session**

1. Patient describes a scene on the beach with secure feeling
2. Therapist reinforces and extends the scene by:
   * Mirroring: "You can feel that they’re there for you, when and if you need them."
   * Bringing attention to felt experience: "Notice what you feel inside now."
   * Amplifying positive states: "Feel happy. And there’s like a confidence too."
   * Anchoring positive states in body experience: "Become even more familiar with this feeling, and what it’s like as you experience it in your body."
3. Introducing time expansion to reinforce the patient's experience of safety
4. As indications of internalized secure base appear in a patient's daily life, the therapist:
   * Delights in these new experiences
   * Applies the same reinforcing methods used in IPF imagery: mirroring and amplifying positive states
   * Suggests bringing that sense of greater security to other circumstances.

**Bringing Secure Base to Other Circumstances**

1. Patient identifies a situation where they want to feel more secure
2. Therapist suggests imagining feeling secure in that situation while maintaining the inner, felt experience of a secure base.
3. Continue imagining each step toward the desired action in the context of an inner, felt experience of a secure base.

### Working in this way with the patient’s present experience allows for a gradual reduction in the frequency of using the IPF protocol. At this stage of 

**IPF Protocol in Attachment-Based Therapy**

* The IPF (Imaginal Processing of Fear) protocol is used to help patients develop a secure base and regulate affective states.
* At later stages of treatment, the IPF protocol continues to be beneficial for:
  + Reinforcing secure-base experience
  + Working with present-day affective states

**Secure Base Experience**

* Secure base results from new, positive attachment representations.
* Stronger and more stable representations lead to a stronger and more stable secure base.
* Signs of insecurity may reappear when the secure base is challenged until new attachment maps are deeply established.

**IPF Protocol Application**

* Bring patient's present experience into the session.
* Address signs of less security with IPF sessions.
* Use general or specific imagery based on the presenting affective state.

**Example: Anxiety**

1. Establish that there is no current threat to security.
2. Evoke anxiety in the present session.
3. Initiate IPF protocol:
   * Ask patient to imagine being a young child feeling anxious.
   * Introduce ideal parents who are attuned to the anxious state.
4. Reestablish secure base and bring it back to the current situation.
5. Patient experiences comfort, confidence, and security in the imagery.
6. Return to the present and apply learned skills to real-life situations.

**Example: Sadness**

1. Focus on the uncomfortable affect state.
2. Imagine being in the circumstance that contributed to the sadness.
3. Initiate IPF protocol:
   * Ask patient to imagine being a young child feeling sad.
   * Introduce ideal parents who are attuned to the sad state.
4. Explore and work with the imagery to alleviate the sadness.
5. Continue using IPF protocol throughout treatment for affect regulation.

### Common Challenges During the IPF Treatment Process

**Common Challenges During IPF Treatment Process**

* Therapists may face challenges in implementing IPF protocol: 1) patient difficulties, 2) therapist difficulties, 3) patient-therapist dyad difficulties
* Empathic response is crucial when patients experience discomfort or resistance
	+ Understanding of painful childhood experiences
	+ Soothing and protective responses
	+ Beneficial for accessing attachment dysfunction
* Maintain collaborative stance
	+ Model curiosity, interest, confidence, patience
	+ Highlight availability to address difficulties
* Contextualize patient difficulties within IPF imagery frame
	+ Parent figures respond to difficulties
	+ Reinforces the frame and attachment-repair process

**Difficulties Patients May Experience with IPF Protocol**

* Empathic response essential for initial discomfort or resistance
* Dismissing attachment patients may not initially experience discomfort but struggle with engagement
* Collaborative stance: model curiosity, interest, confidence, patience
* Contextualize difficulties within IPF imagery frame
	+ Parent figures respond to difficulties
	+ Reinforces the frame and attachment-repair process

**Patient Difficulties with Imagining Being a Very Young Child**

* First experiential imagery component of IPF protocol
* Patients may struggle to put themselves in child-self state due to past experiences leading to attachment disturbance
* Empathic response: understanding and soothing
* Collaborative stance: modeling curiosity, interest, confidence, patience
* Contextualize difficulties within IPF imagery frame: parent figures respond to difficulties and reinforce the frame.

### The therapist guides the patient toward the child state experience and asks the patient to nod “when you are feeling yourself as a young child.” If th

**Child State Experience**

* Therapist guides patient towards child state experience by asking them to nod when they feel themselves as a young child.
* If patient indicates absence of child-state feeling or observing stance, therapist encourages continued effort.
* For patients who do not enter child-self state:
  + Trust that patient will eventually come into receptive inner state.
  + Use displacement methods:
    - Imagining solutions from others' experiences.
    - Displacing self with a different child (displaced self).
* If patient cannot imagine being a young child in first or third person, therapist may use broader displacement method.

**Displacement Methods**

* Documentary-show imagery:
  + Patient imagines watching others who had difficulty feeling themselves as young children and reporting what they say.
  + Normalizes difficulty and suggests solutions.
* Displaced self:
  + Therapist asks patient to imagine a scene with a child much like them and proceeds with protocol.
  + After some experience, therapist encourages direct experience of self-as-child.

**Imagining Older Child, Teenager, or Young Adult**

* If patient imagines being an older child, teenager, or young adult:
  + Encourage imagining being even younger.
  + Continue with protocol at imagined age if not effective.
  + Use documentary-show displacement imagery to find ways of imagining being younger.

### It is not uncommon for patients to imagine themselves at different ages during different IPF sessions. Particularly if a patient has in many IPF sessi

**Intro:**

- Patients may imagine different ages during IPF (Imaginal Processing of Family) sessions
- Remapping process and integration can lead to imagining older self
- Therapist accepts older age self and conducts protocol as usual

**Resistance to Imagining Ideal Parent Figures:**

*Active resistance:*
  - Difficult experiences with actual parents may make it hard for patients to imagine ideal parent figures
  - Patients may refuse to continue IPF treatment due to discomfort
  - Therapist empathizes and encourages continuation, suggesting it becomes easier
*Inner child method:*
  - Transition to imagining ideal parent figures
  - Patient-as-child is met by patient-as-best-adult-self
  - Encourage experience of adult self's ways of being with the child

**Feelings of Disloyalty or Dishonoring:**

- Some patients resist imagining ideal parent figures due to fear of disloyalty or dishonoring actual parents
- Therapist emphasizes that there is no intention to discredit actual parents
- Ideal parents would treat actual parents with kindness and respect

**Difficulties Imagining Ideal Parent Figures:**

*No parent figures imagined:*
  - Common for patients, especially those with dismissing attachment
  - Not an indication of inability to engage with the process
  - Reassure patient that it takes time for imagination to create ideal parent figures
*Mismatch of expectation and dominant sensory mode:*
  - Some patients expect to see parent figures but don't have a strong visual imagination
  - Highlight felt sense instead
*Inner child method:*
  - Use when patient has difficulty imagining parent figures
  - Engage child-self with adult-best-self
  - Return to attempts to evoke ideal parent figures after session.

### Imagined parent figures are vague or distant. Either initially or after some period of not imagining any parent figures, the patient may begin to imag

**Imaginal Processing (IP) and Attachment:**

* Imagined parent figures are vague or distant, indicating engagement of attachment system
* Therapist aims to enhance clarity of parent figures within imagery frame
* Patients may bring up actual parents or people they know instead of imagined ideal parents
* Memory vs. imagination: memory reflects past experiences, imagination allows for possibilities
* Encouraging use of imagination to create new, ideal parent figures

**Engagement of Actual Parents:**

* Patients may initially bring up actual parents in remembered or idealized form
* Drawing from memory limits possibilities for secure attachment imagery
* Therapist responds by emphasizing use of imagination to create completely new parents
* Suggestions to incorporate best qualities of actual parents into new figures

**Engagement of People Patients Know:**

* Patients may imagine people they know as ideal parent figures
* Real people are more complicated than imagined ideal figures
* Therapist responds by encouraging use of imagination to create completely new, human parent figures

**Nonhuman Ideal Parent Figures:**

* Some patients create nonhuman ideal parent figures (cartoon characters, animals, aspects of nature)
* Suggests attachment wounds make human attachment figures too threatening
* Therapist prompts patient to imagine human figures but continues with nonhuman figures if patient persists
* With each subsequent IP session, therapist makes specific reference to human parent figures.

### At some point, the patient will begin to imagine human parent figures, and then may have difficulty in any of the ways presented in this section. Only

**Ideal Parent Figures in Imaginal Exposure Therapy**

* Patients may imagine only one clear ideal parent figure or both, with the absent one being less vivid.
* The missing parent figure usually represents the actual parent who was more abusive, neglectful, or absent.
* Therapist allows patient to focus on present parent figure while gently prompting the presence of the other.

**Difficulties in Relationships with Ideal Parent Figures**

* Patients' pre-treatment disturbed attachment representations may cause expectations or experiences of ideal parents behaving poorly.
* Therapist responds within IPF frame by having imagined parents acknowledge and understand patient's concerns, reassuring them.
* If parent figures become rejecting, neglectful, or abusive, therapist calls for a change in the frame and introduces new protective parent figures.

**Breaks from the Imagery Frame**

* Patients with insecure attachment histories may have difficulty establishing ideal parent figures, maintaining positive experiences, or maintaining the imagery frame.
* Memories of actual parents intruding on imagined parent figures can be acknowledged and used to return to the frame.
* Therapist stays within the frame when patient doubts its reality or engages in other ways that break the frame.
* Patients may become affectively overwhelmed, confused, or disoriented during the protocol; therapist maintains the imagery frame and has ideal parent figures respond empathically and effectively to patient's shift of state.

### DIFFICULTIES THAT THERAPISTS MAY HAVE WITH THE IPF PROTOCOL

**Difficulties Therapists May Encounter with IPF Protocol**

**Self-doubt about skill:**

* Greater skill and confidence come with training, study, practice, and experience.
* Address self-doubt through:
  * Rereading this chapter
  * Supervision from qualified practitioners
  * Collaborative approach
  * Ongoing learning and skill development

**Resistance to regular application:**

* Benefits of IPF protocol are most effective with consistent use.
* Resistance may come from self-doubt or patient expectations.
* Flexibility is appropriate in response to crises, but bring patient's experience into the IPF protocol whenever possible.
* Monitor internal resistance and address factors.

**Concern about manipulation:**

* Use of suggestion and shaping are central components of IPF method.
* Concerns about manipulation or control can be addressed by understanding:
  * Patients' freedom to create unique forms within the imagery frame
  * Therapist's role in permissively establishing conditions for attachment system activation
  * Shaping as support for reinforcement of attachment system

**Doubt due to lack of progress:**

* Patience is key when working with IPF method.
* Difficulties with imagined parent figures are expected and should not be interpreted as a sign of ineffectiveness or inappropriateness.
* Secure base signs may take time to emerge, depending on the severity of attachment disturbance.
* Attuned therapist continues IPF work until internalized secure base is established.

### DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO THE PATIENT–THERAPIST DYAD

**Difficulties Pertaining to the Patient-Therapist Dyad**

* Two primary forms of difficulty: collaborative avoidance of IPF protocol and affect-laden breach in collaboration

**Collaborative Avoidance of IPF Protocol**

* Ideal collaboration leads to mutual use of IPF protocol
* Collusion to resist use of IPF protocol can occur
* Both patient and therapist may experience difficulty with the method
* Signs: patient brings crises to sessions, therapist responds instead of using IPF protocol, ambivalence about protocol
* Prevention: recognize potential for collusive avoidance, address together contributing factors

**Affect-Laden Breach in Collaboration (Rupture in Therapy Relationship)**

* Patient breaks imagery frame and expresses negative affect towards therapist
* Therapist does not respond from within the imagery frame or attachment system
* Rupture best addressed in collaborative behavioral system
* Example: patient's anger towards therapist during therapist's vacation announcement
* Collaborative exploration of rupture restores both systems

**Additional Challenges for Each Attachment Subtype**

* Specific challenges to IPF protocol and other treatment pillars addressed in each subtype chapter.

### Recognizing Successful IPF Treatment

**Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Treatment for Attachment Insecurity**

* The IPF method is an efficient, positive-focused approach to treating attachment insecurity.
* It integrates research on conditions that support secure attachment development.
* Therapist guides patient to:
  * Relax and access behavioral memory system.
  * Engage imagination as young child.
  * Create "just right" ideal parent figures.
* Parent figures embody ways of being that meet patient's longings, wants, and needs for attachment security.
* No focus on painful childhood history; instead, new positive experiences through imagination.
* Patient reports profound changes:
  * Increased feelings of warmth, safety, joy.
  * Ability to express feelings freely and deal with difficult situations.
  * Improved self-esteem and relationships.
* IPF method activates attachment, metacognitive, and collaborative behavioral systems.
* Challenges may arise but are expected and met in ways that contribute to attachment security development.
* Ultimately, new positive experiences overwrite old, insecure attachment maps.

**Patient's Experience:**

* 57-year-old woman in therapy for three years before IPF introduced.
* Six sessions with therapist using IPF protocol.
* One self-generated imagery session.
* Profound changes:
  * New, positive experiences through imagination.
  * Increased childhood memories and feelings of joy.
  * Ability to deal with difficult situations with ideal parents' help.
  * Improved relationships and self-esteem.
* Previously felt guilty for enjoying ideal parents but focused on process instead.
* Negative feelings towards real parents faded, realizing they loved her too.
* Feeling of being a bad person gone, increased self-awareness and acceptance.

  - Three components: **metamemory**, **metalearning**, and **metastrategy**
    * Metamemory: knowledge about one's memory capabilities and strategies
    * Metalearning: understanding the process of learning and how to improve it
    * Metastrategy: selecting and applying appropriate cognitive strategies

**Metacognition in Attachment Theory**

- Attachment disturbances: disruptions in the development of secure attachment relationships
  - Influence on mentalization, emotion regulation, and self-concept
- **Metacognitive interventions**: therapeutic approaches focusing on enhancing metacognitive skills to address attachment disturbances

**Theoretical Background of Metacognitive Interventions for Attachment Disturbances**

- **Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT)**: focuses on the ability to understand and explain mental states, emotions, and intentions
  - Enhances metacognitive skills through reflective practice and role-playing
- **Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs)**: promote present-moment awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of thoughts and feelings
  - Improve metacognitive abilities by increasing self-awareness and emotional regulation
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: targets maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors
  - Enhances metacognition through identifying and challenging automatic thoughts, learning new problem-solving strategies, and practicing cognitive restructuring

**Empirical Evidence for Metacognitive Interventions in Attachment Disturbances**

- **Effectiveness**: numerous studies demonstrate the efficacy of metacognitive interventions in addressing attachment disturbances
  - Improvements in mentalization, emotion regulation, and self-concept
- **Moderating Factors**: individual differences (e.g., age, severity of attachment disturbance) may influence intervention outcomes

**Conclusion**

- Metacognitive interventions offer a promising approach to addressing attachment disturbances by enhancing metacognitive skills such as mentalization, emotion regulation, and problem-solving abilities.
- MBT, MBIs, and CBT are effective therapeutic approaches that have demonstrated improvements in individuals with attachment disturbances.
- Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of these interventions and their applicability across various populations.

### The history of the development of metacognitive interventions in attachment-based therapy can be roughly categorized into four historical generations 

**Historical Development of Metacognitive Interventions in Attachment-Based Therapy**

* Four historical generations of metacognition in attachment-based therapy:
  1. Appearance–reality distinction and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)
  2. Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) and mentalization-based treatment (MBT)
  3. Modular approach to metacognitive psychotherapy by Semerari and Liotti
  4. Research on higher cognitive development and full range of metacognitive skills

**First Generation: Appearance–Reality Distinction and the AAI**

* John Flavell's seminal paper in 1979 introduced metacognition as thinking about thinking, focusing on metacognitive strategies.
* Metacognitive knowledge is understanding factors affecting cognitive processes.
* Early research focused on appearance–reality distinction in children.
* Flavell and associates developed a lab test to assess appearance–reality distinction in 3-5 year olds.
* Children were asked about the appearance and reality of objects, revealing their ability to recognize that experiences can be represented differently.
* Three-year-olds generally lacked representational change and diversity, while five-year-olds had a better understanding.
* Alison Gopnik extended research on appearance–reality distinction, focusing on representational change and diversity in children.
* Children's understanding of representational change developed between ages 3 and 5.

### In another experiment, Gopnik and Graf (1988) told children about objects hidden in a drawer. The children were either shown what was in the drawer, t

**Experiments on Children's Metacognition**

* Gopnik and Graf (1988) studied children's ability to identify the source of knowledge about hidden objects.
  * Three-year-olds had difficulty identifying source, especially after a delay.
  * Five-year-olds had no trouble.
* Interpreted as evidence for metarepresentational ability development between ages 3 and 5.

**Appearance–Reality Distinction**

* Harris et al. (1986) investigated children's ability to distinguish real from apparent emotions in stories.
  * Four-year-olds had limited ability, six-year-olds were capable.
* Influenced research on attachment and metacognition.

**Metacognition: Thinking About Thought**

* Defined as reflecting on the nature, validity, and source of thoughts (Main, 1991).
* Metacognitive knowledge: reflecting on the nature of thought.
* Metacognitive monitoring: reflecting on its source and validity.

**Metacognition and Attachment**

* Main et al. (2002) looked at metacognition in relation to attachment status.
  * Secure vs. insecure children differ in metacognitive abilities.
  * Insecure children have metacognitive deficits, leading to multiple internal working models.
  * Secure children construct a single, coherent internal working model.

**Metacognition and Development**

* Secure vs. insecure toddlers differ in self-directed speech and self-correcting strategies.
* Six-year-olds understand privacy of thought.

**Metacognitive Monitoring Scale on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

* Recognition of appearance–reality distinctions, representational change, and diversity.
* Fresh comments monitoring reaction patterns.
* Error monitoring: acknowledging potential distortions or limitations in beliefs or memories.
* Rating scale: none, possible, some monitoring, marked monitoring, metacognitive monitoring characterizing the interview.

**Limitations of First-Generation Research**

* Poor representation of range and types of metacognition on AAI.
* Limited to self-monitoring, does not address other's state of mind.

**Second-Generation Research**

* Fonagy et al.'s research addresses these limitations.

### SECOND GENERATION: INTERSUBJECTIVITY, MENTALIZATION, AND THE REFLECTIVE FUNCTIONING SCALE

**Second Generation: Intersubjectivity, Mentalization, and Reflective Functioning Scale**

- Developed by Peter Fonagy, Anthony Bateman, and associates from the London School or group
- Heavily influenced by developmental theory of mind research and social biofeedback theory of parental-affect mirroring by Gyorgy Gergely and John Watson
- Expanded recognition of metacognition as intersubjective and bidirectional
- Metacognitive capacity develops between child and caregiver, co-created together

**Recognition of Intentionality and Parental Affect Mirroring**

- Children develop capacity to detect other's intention around 9-12 months
- Recognition of intentionality allows representation of beliefs, desires, emotions of others
- Gergely and Watson criticize Meltzoff and Gopnik's hypothesis on imitation as insufficient for emotional awareness development
- Parental affect mirroring plays vital role in emotional self-awareness and control
- Secure mothers' spontaneous facial displays match infant's affect display, enhancing synchronization

**Parent-Child Interaction: Contingency Detection and Marking**

- Infant discovers caregiver's response is contingent upon own behavior
- Inference of being an active causal agent
- Caregiver's marking (producing exaggerated emotional expression) critical for child's learning
- Child decouples emotion from caregiver's and becomes sensitive to interoceptive cues
- Repetitive presentation of external reflection serves as "teaching" function, leading to awareness of internal cues and emotion categories

**Impact on Mentalization Capacity**

- Infant constructs separate representation for marked affect
- New representation functions as secondary representational structure
- Foundation of mentalization

**Functions of Parental Affective Mirroring**

- Sensitization to internal states
- Building of secondary representations
- Regulation of child's internal emotional state
- Developing a generalized affective communication code based on pretend, play, and knowing representations as representations

### Gergely and Watson (1996) also briefly discuss the developmental psychopathology implications of parental “deviant mirroring styles.” When parents pro

**Parental "Deviant Mirroring Styles" and Developmental Psychopathology**

- Gergely and Watson (1996) discuss implications of parental mirroring styles on emotion development.
  - Congruent but unmarked mirroring: emotion not decoupled from parent, secondary representation not established.
    * Example: "You're uncomfortable."
  - Marked but noncongruent mirroring: infant develops distorted self-representations.
    * Example: Mother laughingly says, "You’re so uncomfortable."
  - Contingency detection is active over the lifespan, allowing for change through therapy or beneficial experiences.

**Reflective Function (RF) and its Development in Children**

- Expanded understanding of metacognitive capacity in children by London group.
- RF: reflecting on self and others' mental states and distinguishing inner and outer reality.
  * Organizes experience of behavior in terms of mental state constructs.
  - Predicted by beliefs and desires, influenced by theories of Freud, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, John Bowlby, Daniel Stern, etc.
- Fonagy and Target (1997): RF permits child to respond to others' beliefs, feelings, hopes, pretense, and plans.
  * Develops from caretaker who sees relationships in terms of mental content.
  - Secure attachment and less reliant on defensive behaviors.

**Assessing Reflective Function (RF) with the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S)**

- Developed by Fonagy and colleagues to assess reflective capacity regarding self and other's mental states.
  * Wider range of metacognitive capacities than AAI Metacognitive Monitoring scale.
- RF-S assesses four discrete categories or dimensions of reflective functioning:
  1. **Awareness of the nature of mental states** (knowing that people have thoughts, feelings, and intentions).
     * Example: "People think and feel things." (RF score: 2)
  2. **Explicit effort to tease out mental states underlying behavior** (making inferences about others' mental states based on their actions).
     * Example: "He might be feeling sad because his dog died." (RF score: 3)
  3. **Recognition of the developmental dimension of mental states** (understanding that mental states change over time and can be influenced by experiences).
     * Example: "My mom was angry when I was a kid, but now she's more understanding." (RF score: 4)
  4. **Recognition of mental states in relation to the interviewer** (understanding that the interviewer has mental states and that these states influence the interview).
     * Example: "I think you might be confused about what I meant." (RF score: 5)
- RF is a unified process, but RF-S assesses these four discrete categories to guide clinicians.

### A. Awareness of the nature of mental states (recognition of the characteristics of mental states in self and others): 1. Opaqueness of mental states. 

**Mental States Awareness**

* Recognition of the characteristics of mental states in self and others

**Opaqueness of Mental States**

* Uncertainty regarding a mental state or alternative mental states associated with behavior
* Example: "I think that my relationship with my parents became closer in my early 20s, but I’m not sure." (4)

**Mental States as Susceptible to Disguise**

* Awareness that mental states can be disguised or hidden
* Example: "I think that my relationship with my parents grew closer when I became a young adult, although my parents quickly became financially dependent on me, so it was hard to tell how they really felt." (5)

**Limitations on Insight**

* Awareness of limitations in understanding self and others
* Example: "I think that my mother felt closer to me when I began to have children, but I'm not sure." (4)

**Mental States Tied to Expressions of Appropriate Normative Judgments**

* Recognition of mental states as expectable responses to specific circumstances
* Example: "When I was 18, I started to stay out past 10. She gave me the ‘cold shoulder’ on these occasions, I guess because she was angry and like many adults didn’t understand that I had matured to adolescence." (3)

**Defensive Nature of Certain Mental States**

* Recognition that mental states can be modified to reduce negative affect
* Example: "He seemed to ignore times when I was respectful, I guess because he believed in strict parenting." (5)

### B. The explicit effort to identify mental states underlying a given behavior (identification of possible mental states that may account for behavior, 

**Mental State Identification**

- Explicitly recognizing and understanding mental states that underlie behaviors in self and others
  - Accurate attribution of mental states to others:
    * Specific causal accounts of behavior based on mental states
    * Example: parents' views about child rearing, perception of improved relationship during adulthood
  - Envisioning the possibility of unrelated feelings:
    * Recognition that affect may be inconsistent with reality
    * Example: feeling a better relationship while incarcerated
  - Recognition of diverse perspectives:
    * Acknowledgment that different people perceive behaviors/situations differently
    * Example: becoming the parent and child in relationships
  - Taking into account one's own mental state:
    * Interpreting others' behavior considering personal feelings
    * Example: less communication after moving out, not invited to wedding
  - Evaluating mental states based on impact:
    * Awareness of role of mental states in behaviors
    * Example: being needy and demanding
  - Considering how others perceive one:
    * Recognition of influence of actions/reactions on others' perceptions
    * Example: seen as pushy but lacked confidence
- Fresh perspective:
  - Spontaneous expressions about mental states
  - Example: reevaluating father's refusal to talk about the past.

### C. Recognizing developmental aspects of mental states (includes acknowledgment of the influence of one generation on the next, showing understanding o

**Recognizing Developmental Aspects of Mental States:**

* Taking an intergenerational perspective, recognizing the exchange of ideas, feelings, and behavior across generations (1)
* Taking a developmental perspective, acknowledging that mental states and perspectives change with age (2)
* Revising thoughts and feelings about childhood in light of understanding gained since childhood (3)
* Envisioning changes in mental states between past, present, and future (4)
* Understanding transactional processes between parent and child, recognizing the influence and impact on each other (5)
* Understanding factors that developmentally determine affect regulation, awareness of a child's dependence on caregiver for emotional regulation (6)
* Awareness of family dynamics, seeing the family as an interdependent system (7)

**Mental States in Relation to the Interviewer:**

* Acknowledging the separateness of mind, recognizing that interviewer has a unique set of experiences and mental stance (1)
* Not assuming knowledge, making efforts to help interviewer understand by clarifying confusing aspects (2)
* Emotional attunement, recognizing that interviewer might be affected by the material provided and acknowledging potential reasons why (3)

**Reflective Functioning (RF) Scoring:**

* RF-S scale ranges from –1 to 9
* –1: Distinctly anti-reflective or bizarre/inappropriate RF
* 0: Disavowed or absent RF
* 1: Absent but not repudiated RF
* 3: Questionable or Low RF
* 5: Definite or Ordinary RF
* 7: Marked RF
* 9: Exceptional RF

### A score of –1 to 1 is consistent with disorganized attachment. A score of less than 3 is consistent with disorganized status or dismissing or anxious-

**Attachment Security and Reflective Functioning (RF)**

- RF score ranges from -1 to 1:
  - Disorganized attachment: -1 to less than 3
  - Dismissing or anxious-preoccupied insecure status: less than 3
  - Insecure or secure status: 4 or 5
  - Secure status: 6 to 9
- RF goes beyond self-monitoring to include mentalizing about mental states of self and others
- Two fundamental factors operating across the four dimensions of RF:
  - Capacity to recognize representations as constructions
  - Capacity to take perspective and contextualize mental states

**Research on Reflective Functioning (RF)**

- Fonagy et al. (1995) compared parents' RF score and attachment status with infants' Strange Situation procedure assessments
- Parents with insecure status and high RF more likely to have secure infants than insecure parents with low RF
- RF is relevant for effective clinical assessment and treatment

**Limitations of Reflective Functioning (RF)**

- RF is seen as a unitary function, but deficits in metacognition are often pathology-specific
- Third generation of metacognitive research addresses this limitation by focusing on different metacognitive strengths and deficits for various clinical conditions.

### THIRD GENERATION: THE MODULAR, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY-SPECIFIC APPROACH

**Third Generation: The Modular, Psychopathology-Specific Approach**

* Antonio Semerari, Giancarlo Dimaggio, Giovanni Liotti, and associates at the Third Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy in Rome have refined understanding of metacognition and its appearance in clinical populations.
* Metacognition viewed as a number of independent capacities rather than a unitary construct with various dimensions.
* Developed Metacognitive Assessment Scale (MAS) to assess metacognitive capacities in patients with BPD, NPD, and DID.
* Discovered "pathology-specific" deficits in particular metacognitive capacities but not others for each diagnosis.
* Allowed construction of specific "metacognitive profiles" for patients based on diagnosis and MAS results.

**Six Distinct Metacognitive Capacities**

1. **Identification:**
   * Ability to distinguish, recognize, and define one's own or another's inner states (emotions, cognitions).
   * Divided into two subfunctions: recognizing one's own representations and recognizing emotions.
   * Examples: "I felt sad when I heard the news", "She always thinks that she’s treated unfairly", "I’m angry", "She was really happy when she saw me".

2. **Relating Variables:**
   * Ability to establish relations among separate components of mental states and between mental states and behavior.
   * Through RV, a subject explains their own behavior in terms of causes and/or motivations.
   * Examples: "I didn’t answer the phone because I didn’t want to speak to him", "He was angry at me because I hadn’t helped him", "I felt sad because I really wanted her to like me".

3. **Differentiation:**
   * Ability to recognize that the contents of representations are subjective events and different from reality.
   * Acknowledges the subjectivity of our representations and recognizes the limits of their influence on reality.
   * Examples: "Giovanni is convinced that if he doesn’t walk the same road every morning, a catastrophe will happen, but I know that it is one of his fantasies and not a premonition", "On the bus I think that everybody is looking at me, but they’re probably just thinking about their own business".

4. **Integration:**
   * Ability to work out coherent descriptions of one's mental states and processes.
   * Takes a narrative form and gives a sense of continuity.
   * Divided into two items: providing an integrated description of one’s own mental state and describing changes over time in one’s own mental states.
   * Example: "First I felt scared, but as I started to realize that the people there were friendly, I became less scared, and was aware of being excited".

5. **Decentration:**
   * Ability to comprehend another individual's mental state from a non-egocentric perspective.
   * Enables recognizing the hypothetical nature of our reading of other individuals’ minds.
   * Example: "She wasn’t looking at me, and at first I thought that she was deliberately ignoring me. But then I realized that she was probably just thinking of her plans for tomorrow and not about me at all".

6. **Mastery:**
   * Ability to work through one's representations and mental states with a view to implementing effective action strategies.
   * Defined as regulation and control activities.
   * Divided into three levels: first-level strategies, second-level strategies, and third-level strategies.
   * Awareness of one’s state in a way that leads to regulation or change of that state.

**Metacognitive Deficits in BPD and NPD Patients**

* BPD patients showed relatively normal metacognitive identification and relating variables but significant deficits in differentiation early on, severe deficits in integration and mastery that didn't change much throughout the course of therapy.
* Examples from a patient diagnosed with BPD: "I was furious", "I’ve been feeling this way since he didn’t call me back", "I hate him and I always have and I always will", "I might as well kill myself because there’s nothing else I can do".
* NPD patients showed an initial deficit in metacognitive identification and a stronger deficit in relating variables that improved slowly over the course of treatment. Differentiation failures varied throughout the course of treatment, integration improved over treatment, and mastery was moderate.
* Examples from a patient diagnosed with NPD: "I don’t have any feelings about her. I don’t have any feelings, period", "I don’t have a clue why this is so", "She’s been sending me emails every day. I know she’s trying to flatter me", "Don’t ask me why, but I know she’s madly in love with me", "I’m just going to label her emails as spam. No way am I going to write her back".
* Effective treatment for BPD must include improving their metacognitive differentiation, integration, and mastery.
* Given the BPD patient's relatively normal capacity for metacognitive identification of states, fostering core mindfulness in DBT may not be a specific enough intervention for patients with BPD.

### FOURTH GENERATION: BEYOND MENTAL CONSTRUCTIONS AND RELATIVISM OF MENTAL STATES

**Fourth Generation of Metacognition:**

- London and Rome groups have advanced understanding of metacognitive functioning and its clinical value, particularly for patients with personality disorders and attachment disturbances (Benefits of Metacognitive Development)
- Third generation metacognitive research and treatment limited:
  - Reflective Function (RF) concept is based on second-order intersubjectivity or constructivist theory of mind
  - Rome group expands metacognition beyond constructivism to relativism of mental states but does not account for developmental levels beyond these concepts

**Beyond Constructivism and Relativism:**

- Necessary to consider entire trajectory of life span development (Entire Picture of Metacognition)
- Metacognitive development continues after childhood (Continued Development)
- Later occurring metacognitive types relevant to mental health (Relevance to Mental Health)

**Advanced Understanding of Mind:**

- Wallin's tertiary subjectivity: Patients may transcend constructed mind through mindfulness practices (Transcendent Knowing)
- Wilber's Integral theory: Levels of knowing beyond constructivism and relativism, reflecting a transcendent "metamap" (Levels of Knowing)

**Fourth Generation Metacognition:**

- Each level of mind associated with specific types of metacognition
- Developing advanced metacognitive possibilities beneficial for treating attachment and other disturbances (Fourth Generation Field)
- Integrating advanced metacognitive understanding into treatment heralds new generation in the field (New Generation)

### The Spectrum of Adult Development

**Adult Development:**

- Building upon Piaget's theory, researchers have identified stages of mature adult development beyond formal operational thinking.
- Notable models include Commons et al.'s postformal reasoning, Labouvie-Vief's postformal stages, Kegan's self-development stages, and Wilber's full-spectrum model.

**Postformal Reasoning:**

- According to Commons et al., there are stages beyond formal operational thinking: fifth-order (systematic), sixth-order (metasystematic), and seventh-order (cross-paradigmatic) thinking.
- Fifth-order thinking is complete and exhaustive within a class, sixth-order thinking defines relationships between systems, and cross-paradigmatic thinking relates fields that appear independent.

**Cognitive Development Stages:**

- **Formal Operational Thinking (Piaget):** Last stage of cognitive development described by Piaget, developing during adolescence.
- **Labouvie-Vief's Postformal Stages:**
  - Intrasystemic (formal operational thinking)
  - Intersystemic: expansion of context and awareness of meanings beyond the information given
  - Autonomous: logic of self-regulating systems, creativity, and generativity across generations

**Self-Development Stages:**

- Kegan's stages describe a succession of qualitative differentiations of the self from the world.
- Each stage represents an expanded context in which the self emerges.
- Corresponding Piagetian stages: incorporative self/sensorimotor, impulsive self/preoperations, imperial self/concrete operations, interpersonal self/early formal operations, institutional self/full formal operations, and interindividual self (postformal thinking).

**Ego Development:**

- Loevinger presented a nine-stage model of ego development.
- Cook-Greuter built upon this foundation and further researched the postformal stages.
- Transition from formal to postformal ego development: individualist stage (awareness of perspective, context, and constructs) and autonomous stage (metasystematic thinking, focusing on potential, and integrating conflicting frameworks).
- Construct-aware post-autonomous stage: awareness of the limits of representational knowledge and the processes of thinking itself.
- Ego sense becomes aware of itself as a temporary construct.

### At the universal or unitive stage (the ninth in the model and labeled as 6), there is a “change to a concept of field (vision)[,] . . . [a] quantum le

**Universal or Unitive Stage (6th in the model, labeled as 9)**

- Marks a quantum leap in experience and outlook
- Characterized by a concept of field (vision)
- Yearning to transcend rational, conscious egos
- Direct attunement awareness instead of representational thinking
- Global, transpersonal, or ego-transcendent experience
- Individuals experience themselves and others as part of ongoing humanity
- Multiperspectival capacity: ability to take multiple points of view
- Self-perception is "No-'thing'," beyond the ego, integrated with a higher Unity
- Self is created anew at every moment
- Transcends limitations of representational thinking for direct awareness of ultimate truth

**Cook-Greuter's Stage Model of Ego Development Assumptions:**

- The more differentiated and objective self-view, the closer to truth
- Highest stages transcend representational thinking for direct awareness of ultimate truth

**Integral Psychology and Integral Spirituality by Ken Wilber:**

- Comprehensive model of multiple lines of human development
- Includes highest stages described in spiritual traditions
- Reviewed 100 models of developmental sequences
- Found structural coherence reflecting a universal framework for all developmental lines
- Uses metaphor of 12 bandwidths of light to indicate structural levels of developmental lines

**Intellectual/Cognitive Line:**

- Piaget's stages align with the first five bandwidths
- Formal operational thinking corresponds to orange stage (5th)
- First postformal cognitive stage is green, pluralistic or relativistic and early-vision logic (6th position)

**Higher Cognitive Stages:**

- Teal: systemic thinking and middle-vision logic (7th position)
- Turquoise: higher systemic thinking and late-vision logic (8th position)
- Indigo: global and ego-transcendent, awakened or illumined mind (9th position)
- Violet: all dimensions present simultaneously (10th position)
- Ultraviolet and clear light: highest attainments (11th and 12th positions)

### A UNIFIED MODEL OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF COGNITION AND METACOGNITION

**Unified Model of Cognition and Metacognition Development**

* Structural model with stages of cognitive and metacognitive development
* Three lowest levels: infrared, magenta, red (egocentric orientation)
	+ Sensorimotor (infrared) - Piaget's sensorimotor stage
	+ Preoperational (magenta, red) - Piaget's preoperational stages
* Fourth stage: amber (ethnocentric orientation)
	+ Concrete operational thinking - Piaget
	+ Symbiotic, impulsive, self-protective, conformist, and conscientious stages - Loevinger and Cook-Greuter
	+ Internal sense of "mind" development
	+ Expansion of emotional range
	+ Peak of fantasy involvement
	+ Stabilization of attention
	+ Metacognitive skills: immediate awareness of mind, represent state of mind of others, meaning-making based on social approval and manifest content
* Fifth stage: orange (formal operational thinking)
	+ Appreciation of primary elements within a system
	+ Deductive reasoning emerges
	+ Metacognitive skills: efficacy and mastery, awareness of latent meaning, understanding connection between actions and consequences, projecting long-term goals
* Sixth stage: individualist/systematic (intersystemic relationships)
	+ Complete and exhaustive operations within the same class of cognitive objects
	+ Heightened sensitivity to context
	+ Understanding underlying assumptions, schemas, and expectancies
	+ Capacity to take perspective and understand how point of view influences experience
	+ Optimizing options in the face of limitations
* Seventh stage: autonomous (metasystematic)
	+ Shift from logical systems to self-regulation
	+ Thinking in terms of relations between one system and another
	+ Emerging capacity to think in terms of an overarching supersystem
	+ Awareness of interdependence
	+ Definition of a unique purpose in life
	+ Capacity to resolve internal conflict or contradiction
	+ Ability to directly perceive the degree of organization or disorganization of state of mind
* Eighth stage: construct-aware (cross-paradigmatic)
	+ Discovery that conceptual knowledge interferes with knowing via direct experience or awareness
	+ Thought as a mode of knowledge becomes problematic and is eventually superseded by direct knowing through immediate awareness
	+ Appreciation for the self as a central organizer
	+ Recognition of the supersystemic order to life
* Ninth stage: universal/unitive (ego-transcendence)
	+ Merging of individual consciousness with universal consciousness
	+ Awareness of vast oceanlike field of consciousness
	+ Center of experience, identity, and action becomes the oceanlike awareness
	+ Metacognitive skills: disappearance of reactivity of mind, taking multiple perspectives, instantaneous monitoring of states of mind, nonreified flexible self, spontaneous compassion for shared humanity
* Clinical Applications
	+ Promoting metacognitive skills in patients
	+ Basic metacognitive skills: awareness of state of mind in self and others
		- Fostering greater awareness of internal experience
		- Helping patients become more aware of their own internal state and the state of others
		- Techniques: focusing on feelings, recognizing negative self-talk, using hypnosis for subtitles method.

### To enhance awareness of underlying maladaptive beliefs and schemas, the clinician might say, “What were the assumptions you were making about . . . ? 

**Mindfulness and Awareness in Psychotherapy**

* Clinician asks patients introspective questions to enhance self-awareness of beliefs, wishes, needs, and emotional states.
* Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) incorporates mindfulness meditation for continuous, nonreactive awareness.
* Patients learn to be present to their experiences without reacting defensively.
* Self-rating scales help patients reflect on their degree of awareness.
* Reinforcing awareness of emotional states through affective marking.
* Developing perspective-taking and empathy skills (mentalization) by wondering about others' motivations, feelings, needs, and beliefs.
* Therapist models mentalizing behavior to help patients develop curiosity towards their own and others' state of mind.
* Tips for therapists to influence mentalizing include:
  * Wondering out loud about the patient's state of mind.
  * Disclosing therapist's thoughts and feelings.
  * Asking specific questions about feelings, thoughts, needs, and motivations in situations.
  * Encouraging patients to wonder about others' mental states.
* Clinical example: Patient learns to understand her mother's perspective and develop a compromise for their relationship.

### Metacognitive Monitoring

**Metacognitive Monitoring**

- Helping patients increase accuracy in assessing their own states of mind
- Patients with poor self-assessment may exhibit various degrees of errors:
  - Source-monitoring mistakes
  - Confusing fantasies or dreams with memories
  - Logical contradictions in beliefs
  - Passive influence
  - Serious lapses in reality-testing
  - Inner speech confusion

**Fostering Objective Attitude**

- Encourage patients to develop objective, critical attitude towards reported memories
- Example: Female patient with false belief of daughter's abuse
  * High suggestibility on Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale
  * Encouraged to develop objective, critical attitude instead of focusing on risk
  * Convinced no abuse occurred and worked out custody arrangement

**Positive Hallucinations vs. Reality-Monitoring**

- Nonpathological, highly hypnotizable subjects can create positive hallucinations by suspending reality-monitoring
- For patients with deficits in reality-testing:
  * Activate and strengthen their reality-monitoring function
  * Use a scale to estimate the degree of external vs. internal perception of voices or experiences
  * Explore potential sources of voices or experiences

**Inner Wisdom Technique**

- Connect with inner wisdom to accurately detect source of voices or experiences
- Repeatedly appeal to patient's inner reality-monitoring capacity
- Hallucinated voices are eventually seen as inner thoughts

**Cognitive Dissonance Model of Treatment**

- Errors in monitoring contradictory and extremely irrational beliefs best handled using cognitive dissonance model
- Introduce language of parts to heighten dissonance between conflicting beliefs
- Appeal to other parts of the mind to resolve deep conflict and reduce dissonance.

### Contingency Detection and Metacognitive Mastery It is one thing to help patients to become more aware of their states of mind. It is an entirely diffe

**Contingency Detection and Metacognitive Mastery**

* Awareness of state of mind is different from mastery over it
* Patients with personality and dissociative disorders have low awareness of contingency influence
* Therapist helps patients become aware of their influence on own state of mind and others' behavior
* Explicitly introduce task of gaining mastery over internal states
* Use metaphors like an affect dial to help patients control emotions
* Make it an expectation of treatment that patients will increase control over internal states
* Patients can rehearse in fantasy having control over overwhelming situations
* Displacement technique in hypnosis helps patients learn effective coping strategies

**Action Plans and Goal-Orientation**

* Development of formal operational thinking brings capacity for long-term goals
* Impulsive patients show impaired goal-oriented behavior
* Reflect on possible consequences of behavior as a series of hypotheticals
* Imagine negative consequences of maladaptive actions and positive consequences of adaptive ones
* Develop internal representations of actions and their likely consequences
* Identify healthy goals and develop action plans to achieve them
* Keep journal entries about implementation of action plan and bring problems into treatment sessions
* Successful patients learn to think proactively and let behaviors be guided by action plans.

### Meaning-Making

**Psychoanalytic Tradition and Meaning-Making**

* Contributes to metacognition through fostering meaning-making
* Therapy aims to help patients formulate the meaning of their inner experience (Stern, 2010)
* Symptoms ameliorated when a patient develops an explanatory model for them (Frank, 1963)
* Dynamic therapy: helps patients make sense of experiences and symptoms
* Orientation towards exploring symptoms and behaviors to understand their meaning
* Explanation of behavior, motivation, emotional states, interpersonal patterns, beliefs, and dreams
* Three levels of meaning: manifest, emotional, and latent or unconscious

**Manifest Meaning**

* Understanding and explanation of immediate experience

**Emotional Meaning**

* Reflects a deeper level than manifest meaning
* Requires accurate identification of emotions and understanding their meanings

**Latent or Unconscious Meaning**

* Identification and understanding repetitive behaviors and long-standing patterns
* Fostering curiosity about the underlying causes

**Intermediate Metacognitive Skills: Postformal Level (Stage 6)**

* Characterized by relativistic thinking and systematic operations
* New metacognitive skills emerge, including:
  * Recognition of how the past shapes current experience
  * Appreciation for the relativity of all states of mind and limitations of knowledge
  * Capacity to see more deeply into underlying assumptions and expectancies
  * Optimization of action plans in the face of perceived limitations
  * Understanding the effects of context on feelings and behaviors
  * Taking perspective and seeing things from another's point of view

**Recognition of How the Past Shapes Current Experience**

* Dynamic therapists foster an attitude towards exploring how early childhood experiences shape current behavior
* Rueful recognition: acknowledging parallels between parental behavior and one's own

**Appreciation for the Relativity of All States of Mind and Limitations of Knowledge**

* Encouraging patients to see their emotions and meanings as temporary constructions
* Helping patients recognize defensiveness and self-deception around certain issues

**Seeing More Deeply Into Underlying Assumptions and Expectancies**

* Patients capable of understanding how underlying assumptions influence state of mind and behavior
* Therapist asks questions to help patients explore underlying beliefs and expectancies.

### Optimizing Action Plans

**Optimizing Action Plans**

At the level of cognitive development in old age, individuals can optimize responses to perceived limitations through a process called selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC). This process is characterized by:

1. **Selection:** Setting goals within available coping resources.
2. **Optimization:** Thoroughly exploring hidden inner resources to establish the best forms of coping and functioning in the face of limitations.

**Process of Optimization:**

a. Imagining a situation where one feels at their best (the "best self"):
   - Patient describes the situation and qualities of the "best self."
   b. Therapist mirrors and enhances these qualities.

c. Changing the scene to a difficult situation:
   - Patient brings "best-self" qualities into the difficult situation.
   - New positive qualities may emerge.

d. Discussing and translating optimizing resources into an action plan for coping with limitations.

**Therapist's Role:**

1. Encouraging exploration of inner resources.
2. Mirroring and enhancing identified qualities.
3. Suggesting bringing "best-self" qualities to difficult situations.
4. Helping patients discover new resources.
5. Assisting in creating an action plan using optimizing resources.

### Sensitivity to Context

**Sensitivity to Context:**

- People become increasingly aware of how context affects their experiences.
- Understanding the context helps with forgiveness and making sense of past behaviors.
- Therapist can foster context-sensitivity by asking about the context of experiences and exploring its relationship to feelings or behaviors.

**Capacity to Take Perspective:**

- People at this stage understand that perspectives are relative and unique.
- Developing a personal perspective is essential for self-development.
- Therapist can foster perspective-taking by asking patients to consider different viewpoints, including their own and others'.

**Advanced Metacognitive Skills: Later Postformal Levels**

**The Ability to Take a Wider Perspective:**

- Patients develop a wider perspective on their condition.
- Therapist can help patients see how their understanding has changed over time and appreciate representational diversity.
- Family-tree work can aid in developing a transgenerational perspective.
- Perspective-taking is fostered by asking patients to take others' perspectives, including the therapist's perspective on their experiences.

### The Ability to Develop an Orientation

**Orientation**

- Specific kind of perspective-taking
- Two types: past versus present, self versus other

**Past vs. Present Orientation**

- Anxious-preoccupied patients: preoccupied with unresolved past experiences
- Therapist helps patient become more aware of relative orientation to past and present
- Use anchoring scale (1-10) to assess awareness

**Self versus Other Orientation**

- Narcissistically vulnerable patients: all self-transference or all other-transference
- Unable to hold both self and other in mind simultaneously
- Therapist uses anchoring scale to help develop metacognitive capacity

**Awareness of Organization or Coherence of Mind**

- Patients with personality and dissociative disorders, insecure attachment have low coherence
- Benefit from learning to accurately perceive organization/disorganization of mind
- Use anchoring scale (1-10) to assess level of organization
- Gradually learn to recognize degree of organization and its association with mental states and external context
- Repeated use fosters increased metacognitive awareness and coherence of mind

**Recognition of Interdependence**

- Patients develop wider perspective recognizing interconnection and interdependence of all things
- Encouraged to adopt common humanity perspective
- Therapist helps patient see connection between own suffering and that of others

**Metacognitive Development**

- Patient develops wider perspective or ultimate concern
- Develops action plans for actualization
- Achieves freedom from internal constraints.

### Contradiction

**The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns** by Emmons (1999)

* Individuals may have contradictory personal strivings leading to diminished wellbeing.
* Developing higher-order goals, or an ultimate concern, reduces internal conflict and increases wellbeing.
* Therapist suggestions for discovering one's ultimate concern:
  * Reflect on central guiding principle of life
  * Identify core purpose giving deepest meaning
  * Articulate details of meaning-system
  * Observe how it affects activities and engagement

**Cognitive Development (Stage 8 - Turquoise)**

* Discovers limitations of conceptual thought in favor of direct awareness.
* Patients become aware of their representational construction processes.
* Direct awareness is seen as a more valid means of knowing than conceptual thought.
* Making the supersystem the basis of operation allows for switching out of conceptual thought.
* Everything can be seen accurately through direct awareness, free from limitations of conceptual knowing.
* Creativity and generativity become salient.

**The Self as a Temporary Functional Organizing Principle (Late Stages of Development)**

* Individual self is no longer experienced as solid or permanent.
* It serves as a functional structure to operate in the relative world but is less the locus of identity.
* Higher-order metacognitive skills develop at Stage 9 (Indigo).

**Higher-Order Metacognitive Skills (Stage 9 - Indigo)**

* Developing universal or ego-transcendent perspective.
* Shifting from systems to a larger field in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism.
* New metacognitive skills:
  * Developing simultaneous, multiple points of view free of contradiction.
  * Immediate awareness and automatic monitoring of ongoing processes.
  * Diminished reactivity to immediate experiences or states of mind.
* These forms of metacognitive functioning may emerge spontaneously through practice.
* Therapist encourages reflection, description, and recognition of changes in these skills.

### Overview

- Not all metacognitive capacities described in this chapter will be applicable to every patient.
- Patients exhibit a spectrum of developmental levels and corresponding foundations for cognitive and metacognitive functioning.
- Tailor metacognitive capacity development based on individual patient needs:
  * Perspective-widening methods for limited perspective-taking ability.
  * Organization methods for disorganized thinking.
  * Later-stage development and higher metacognitive capacities as patients progress.
- Collaborative approach to therapy:
  * Patient-centered treatment based on problematic deficits.
  * Continued development towards greater potentials of functioning and wellbeing.
- Next chapter focuses on direct methods for enhancing collaborative capacity.
- Collaboration-enhancing methods beneficial for patients with attachment and personality disorders.
- Incorporating collaboration-enhancing methods contributes to efficient and stable treatment outcomes.

### CHAPTER 10 The Third Pillar Fostering Collaborative Capacity and Behavior

**Chapter 10: The Third Pillar - Fostering Collaborative Capacity and Behavior**

**The Importance of Collaborative Capacity**
- Securely attached individuals exhibit collaborative behavior, which is essential for treatment.
- Cooperation and collaboration are hardwired in humans.
- Insecure attachment impairs the emergence of natural collaborative functioning.

**Cooperative Behavior as an Evolutionary Adaptation (Gilbert, 1989)**
- Cooperative behavior evolved to modify individualistic competitiveness.
- Cooperation leads to social rules and division of labor.
- Cooperativeness is concerned with linking, joining, and minimizing differences.
- Key to cooperation: sharing, communication, and learning social rules.

**Maladaptive Lack of Cooperativeness**
- Inability to cooperate and share lies at the heart of many psychological difficulties.
- Includes tendencies towards competition, submission, fear of deception, etc.

**Healthy Cooperative Behavior**
- Sense of "togetherness" and joining.
- Mutuality and reciprocity.
- Status defined by altruism and contribution.

**Human Infants vs. Apes: Cooperativeness (Tomasello, 2009)**
- Human infants are intrinsically altruistic.
- Display helping, informing, and sharing behaviors.
- Shared intentionality is the underlying principle of human cooperativeness.

**Shared Intentionality**
- Ability to create joint intentions and commitments in cooperative endeavors.
- Structured by processes of joint attention and mutual knowledge.

**Human Infants' Cooperative Behavior**
- Helping, informing, and sharing behaviors emerge early.
- Indiscriminate cooperativeness at a young age.
- Cultural norms internalized by the end of third year.

### Collaborative Communication and Shared Intentionality

**Collaborative Communication and Shared Intentionality**

- Tomasello (2009) defines collaboration as mutualism, shared intentionality, joint goals, division of labor, and shared focus of attention (pp. 52-58, 61, 67, 70, 90).
- Collaboration is essential for human evolution and development (p. 54).
- Human children collaborate with others from early ontogeny (p. 105).
- Cooperation and collaborative communication coevolved (p. 74).
- Communication behavior in infancy is inherently collaborative (p. 242).

**Cooperation and Collaboration in Children with Caregivers and Peers**

- Secure children expect caregiver's help, while insecure children do not (pp. 129-131).
- Secure infants look longer when caregiver leaves during distress, insecure infants are surprised by their return (Tomasello, 2009, citing Johnson, Dweck, & Chen, 2007).
- Abused children do not show empathic concern for distressed peers (Tomasello, 2009, citing Main & George, 1985).
- Heard et al. describe a "peer interest sharing" system where participants are equals (pp. 87-89).

**Clinical Relevance of Lack of Cooperation and Collaborativeness**

- Insecure and abused children show impaired nonverbal and verbal cooperative and collaborative behavior (p. 132).
- These patterns persist throughout childhood and into adulthood (p. 132).
- Therapeutic task is to provide corrective developmental conditions for collaboration in therapy (p. 132).

### Defining Psychotherapy as Collaborative Partnership: The Contribution of Interpersonal Psychotherapy Harry Stack Sullivan was the first psychotherapis

**Defining Psychotherapy as a Collaborative Partnership**

- Harry Stack Sullivan's definition of psychotherapy:
  - Cooperation: favoring shared goals over competition
  - Collaboration: intersubjectivity, sensitivity to another person, and mutual exploration
  - Distinct from juvenile cooperation and competition

**Sullivan's View on Psychotherapy as a Collaborative Partnership**

- Cooperation: giving and taking around shared goals
- Collaboration: feeling of sensitivity to another person
- Therapy is "a matter of we"
- Evolutionary perspective: cooperation puts aside competition for shared interests, collaboration involves mutual regulation

**Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) as a Collaborative Partnership**

- Teyber and McClure's definition: psychotherapy as a collaborative partnership
- Therapist's role: articulate clear expectations, enact collaborative behavior
- Therapy is a shared interaction requiring participation from both parties

**Application of the Collaborative Partnership Concept in Psychotherapy**

- Applicable to all good psychotherapies
- Challenge with attachment-impaired patients: they are not cooperative or collaborative, yet therapy requires cooperation and collaboration
- Focus of attachment-based treatment: help patients become cooperative and collaborative for their lives and therapy process

**Starting Points: Fostering Collaboration at the Beginning of Therapy**

- Importance of fostering collaboration from the start
- Clear communication, empathy, and understanding
- Establishing a safe and trusting environment
- Encouraging active participation and engagement from the patient.

### A MUTUALLY NEGOTIATED TREATMENT PLAN AND INFORMED CONSENT

**Collaborative Therapy:**

- Begins with exploring patient's hopes and expectations for treatment
- Identifying main problems and establishing mutually agreed-upon goals
- Asking hypothetical questions to invite exploration of treatment success
- Sharing therapist's impressions and expectations
- Mutually negotiated treatment plan: engaging client in assessing issues, past experiences, and shared goals
- Shared decision-making about best approach to treatment
- Transparent therapists openly discuss diagnostic impressions, reasoning, and anticipated difficulties
- Stronger alliance between therapist and patient
- Collaborative interpersonal process provides corrective emotional experience
- Determinant of treatment outcome: mutual collaboration

**Process of Collaboration:**

- Exploration of patient's hopes and expectations
  * Identifying main problems
  * Hypothetical question about treatment success
- Sharing therapist's impressions and expectations
  * Mutually negotiated treatment plan
  * Transparent therapists: open discussion of diagnostic impressions, reasoning, and difficulties
- Informed Consent Document
  * Explicit and tangible collaboration partnership
  * Signed by both patient and therapist

**Benefits of Collaborative Therapy:**

- Stronger alliance between therapist and patient
- Corrective emotional experience for clients
- New way of interacting for many clients
- Determinant of treatment outcome: mutual collaboration

### ESTABLISHING THE TREATMENT FRAME AS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP

**Establishing the Treatment Frame as Collaborative Partnership**

- Patients with attachment disturbances have impaired collaborativeness and may withdraw or make excessive demands.
- A detailed treatment frame contract is necessary to define roles and expectations, reducing misunderstandings and treatment ruptures.
- Emphasis on negotiation and collaboration during contract development, not the contract itself as a signed document.

**Safety Expectations in Treatment Frame Contract**

- Clear expectations and rules regarding safety are essential for attachment-based treatment.
- Establishing safety sets the foundation for therapy as a secure base.
- Addresses potential threats to patient's safety, such as self-harm, substance use, abusive relationships, and dissociative reenactment.

**Collaborative Behavior and Therapy-Interfering Behaviors**

- Collaborative behavior is a goal throughout therapy.
- Clear understanding of how to handle therapy-interfering behaviors like lying, refusing to discuss certain topics, or toxic behavior.
- Open, honest disclosure and communication are crucial for the therapeutic relationship.

**Consistency and Reliability in Treatment Frame Contract**

- Explicit understanding of handling potential disruptions like extended absences, decreased therapy frequency, or financial issues.
- Collaborative development of treatment frame understanding, plan, and informed consent document.

**Fostering a Collaborative State of Mind in Psychotherapy: The Role of the Rome**

- First few sessions prioritize attunement and collaboration before task focus.
- Therapist must be willing to slow down and address patient reactivity for mutual negotiation.

### CENTER OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY

**Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy (Rome) and Attachment Disturbances**

* Importance of fostering collaboration in psychotherapy for patients with attachment disturbances (Liotti, 1999; Cortina & Liotti, 2010)
* Cooperative behavioral system: an innate motivational system mediating cooperative behavior (Liotti, 1999)
* Superior cooperative and communicative abilities essential for early human groups' survival and prosperity (Cortina & Liotti, 2010)

**Fostering a Collaborative State of Mind**

* Deactivated in patients with significant attachment disturbance (Cortina & Liotti, 2010)
* Begin during the first therapy session (Liotti, 1999)
* Foundation of safety and protection in therapy (Liotti & Gilbert, 2011)
* Explicit agreement of goals and rules of therapeutic work (Liotti, 1999)

**Mutual Understanding and Collaborative Exploration**

* Key to cooperation between patient and therapist (Liotti, 2005)
* Ongoing dialogue is more effective than traditional one-sided interpretation (Liotti, 2005)
* Collaborative exploration essential for patients with attachment disturbances (Dimaggio et al., 2007)
* Mutual sharing of information about treatment problems and goals (Dimaggio et al., 2007)
* Therapist's open sharing of session main points fosters collaborative exploration (Dimaggio et al., 2007)

**Collaborative Empiricism in Attachment-Based Treatment**

* Collaborative exploratory exchanges promote mentalizing ability (Allen, 2013)
* Ruptures in therapeutic alliance require collaborative exploration and repair (Liotti, 2005)
* Cooperative/collaborative behavioral system distinct from attachment system (Liotti, 2005)
* Collaborative exploration outside the attachment system can strengthen the attachment relationship (Liotti, 2005)

**Addressing Impaired Collaborative Behavior in Ongoing Therapy**

* Two broad areas of impaired collaborative behavior: nonverbal and verbal

**Nonverbal Collaborative Behavior**

* Synchronization and match with the other's nonverbal behaviors indicative of secure adult patients (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014)
* Desynchronization and mismatches common in adult patients with some pattern of insecure attachment (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014)

**Nonverbal Collaborative Behavior: Focus of Research by Beatrice Beebe**

* Synchronization in timing and match with the other's nonverbal behaviors in secure adult patients (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014)
* Desynchronization and mismatches common in adult patients with some pattern of insecure attachment (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014)

**Verbal Collaborative Behavior**

* Secure attachment on the Adult Attachment Interview indicated by healthy collaboration between interviewee and interviewer (Main, 1991)
* Individuals with insecure attachment rarely show collaborative verbal behavior on the AAI (Main, 1991)
* Collaborativeness assessed through meeting or violating Grice's maxims (Main, 1991)

**Improving Nonverbal and Verbal Collaborative Behavior Throughout Therapy**

* Third pillar of attachment-based treatment (not explicitly stated in text but implied)

### IMPROVING NONVERBAL COLLABORATION

**Improving Nonverbal Collaboration**

Beebe and Lachmann (2014) emphasize the importance of understanding nonverbal interactive mismatches in therapy, as they can be traced back to early interaction disturbances. These mismatches are particularly relevant for individuals with insecure attachment styles. Beebe's research on nonverbal collaboration between infants and caregivers identified two main types of dyadic nonverbal exchanges: collaborative and contradictory.

**Collaborative Nonverbal Exchanges:**

- Secure infant and caregiver show reciprocal influence and highly coordinated, synchronized behaviors.
- Contingent behaviors: each knows that initiated behavior has predictable effects on self or other.
- Repairable mismatches and ruptures.
- Heightened moments of positive affective intensity.
- Child develops well-organized patterns of dyadic interaction and a sense of effectance.

**Contradictory, or Noncollaborative, Mutual Nonverbal Exchanges:**

- Significant and repetitive mismatched nonverbal influence.
- Uncoordinated and desynchronized exchanges.
- Lack of contingent behaviors.
- Frequent ruptures with little possibility of repair.
- Virtual absence of heightened moments of positive affect.
- Child develops dysfunctional patterns of reciprocal nonverbal exchanges and a lack of effectance.

Beebe's research on nonverbal collaboration between infants and caregivers led to the development of methods for transforming dysfunctional patterns of exchange. This work has influenced therapeutic approaches by focusing on nonverbal collaborativeness:

- Beebe and her associates used videotapes to provide mothers with direct visual feedback, helping them learn healthy patterns of exchange and transform interactions with their infants.
- They later applied the video microanalysis method to investigate nonverbal patterns of interaction between adult patients and therapists.
- The "transformational view": dysfunctional nonverbal patterns can be fundamentally changed through therapy, supporting the emergence of secure patterns of interaction.

### The first step toward developing healthy nonverbal collaboration in insecurely attached adult patients is to establish a nonverbal secure base in the 

**Developing Healthy Nonverbal Collaboration in Insecurely Attached Adult Patients**

1. **Establishing a Nonverbal Secure Base:**
   - Therapist's continuous, nondistracted attention and intense engagement
   - Proper position, head orientation, body posture, stillness, gaze, and facial affect display
   - Adjusting arousal and degree of engagement to match the patient
   - Avoiding patterns of nonverbal distancing, hyperengaging, or mismatching

2. **Observing Main Patterns of Nonverbal Exchange:**
   - Using Beebe's categories for coding nonverbal patterns as a starting point
   - Modifications for adult nonverbal exchanges:
     1. Chair position and posture
     2. Head orientation
     3. Gaze
     4. Facial affective display
     5. Initiated self-touch
     6. Postural gestures
     7. Breathing
     8. Vocal rhythm
     9. Vocal tone
     10. Vocal pitch
   - Carefully observing salient and repetitive patterns for both patient and therapist
   - Being vigilant and attuned to nonverbal behaviors, some of which may occur outside awareness

**Patient Nonverbal Patterns:**

- **Dismissing Attachment:**
  * Sits back or slumps in chair
  * Infrequent head and gaze orientation towards therapist
  * Off-putting facial display patterns
  * Defensive postural displays
  * Self-regulatory behaviors
  * Extended silences and curtailed vocalizations
  * Soft or barely audible voice, with descending pitch

- **Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment:**
  * Sits forward in chair or looms
  * Manifests hypervigilant fixed stare
  * Variety of frequent facial displays of distress
  * Exaggerated spontaneous postural displays
  * Plaintive postural displays
  * High postural anxiety like rubbing hands and feet, jiggling legs
  * Inability to remain silent or take turns in vocalization
  * Fast vocal rhythm
  * Vocalizations over the therapist
  * Descending pitch

- **Disorganized Attachment:**
  * Contradictory mixture of dismissing and anxious-preoccupied nonverbal behaviors

### The third step is to identify the most salient and repetitive nonverbal patterns of exchange, especially the most dysfunctional patterns. Identificati

**Step 1:** Identify salient and repetitive nonverbal patterns of exchange, focusing on dysfunctional ones.

- Determine main attachment pattern (secure, dismissing, anxious-preoccupied, or disorganized)
- Identify primary nonverbal behaviors exhibited frequently and repetitively by the patient

**Step 2:** Transform dysfunctional nonverbal exchange patterns through:

- Nonverbal engagement
- "Match-and-change" activity
  * Continually rematching when mismatches occur
  * Responding with purposeful nonverbal behavior
  * Matching patient's nonverbal behavior moment by moment

**Case Illustration:** Dolores

- Failed to make eye contact: Beebe made steady eye contact
- Oriented body posture away from therapist: Identified and collaboratively worked on face-to-face interaction
- Became inaudible: Repeated back patient's utterances with a more flowing rhythm
- Produced still-face reaction: Attempted to make responsive and exaggerated facial displays
- Mutual review of video footage used for learning about own feelings
- Emergence of mutual, dyadic nonverbal affective exchange

**Step 3:** Transform dysfunctional nonverbal exchange patterns through enhancing metacognitive awareness.

- Collaboratively share observations on salient nonverbal behaviors
- Set context for intervention by asking permission to share observations in the moment they occur
- Contribute to decrease of dysfunctional, noncollaborative nonverbal communication and increase of healthy nonverbal communication and collaboration

### Once the patient’s metacognitive awareness of a nonverbal behavior is established, our method entails engaging the patient with experiential focusing 

**Method for Addressing Dysfunctional Nonverbal Behaviors**

1. **Metacognitive Awareness**: Patient becomes aware of specific nonverbal behaviors and their associated emotions.
2. **Experiential Focusing**: Patient explores bodily felt sense of nonverbal behavior and its function (self-regulation or interactive regulation).
3. **Direct Change Experiment**: Patient attempts to change nonverbal behavior to something more collaborative, focusing on resulting felt sense.
4. **Targeted Self-Regulation**: Patient experiments with discontinuing specific self-regulatory behaviors and focuses on underlying emotional/arousal state.
5. **Meaning-Making**: Understanding historical context and meaning of dysfunctional nonverbal patterns through co-constructed interpretation.

**Effects of Interventions**

1. **Contingent Effectiveness**: Patient learns that nonverbal behavior affects therapist's response, and vice versa.
2. **New Pattern of Nonverbal Exchange**: Mutual match-and-change affective displays become frequent, mismatches diminish.
3. **Heightened Positive Affective Moments**: Increase in positive affective moments between patient and therapist contributes to secure therapeutic base.
4. **Nonverbal Disconnection Repair**: Nonverbal disconnections are repaired more easily.
5. **New Preverbal Schemas**: Patient develops new schemas for healthy, collaborative nonverbal exchanges with others.
6. **Enhanced Sense of Being Seen and Known**: Patient experiences increased sense of being seen, known, and contingently matched by the therapist.

### IMPROVING VERBAL COLLABORATION

**Improving Verbal Collaboration**

**Origins of Verbal Collaborative Behavior**

- Human communication is a cooperative enterprise (Tomasello, 2010) based on:
  - Mutually assumed common conceptual ground
  - Mutually assumed cooperative communicative motives
- Shared intentionality is essential for collaborative activities
- Cooperative communication evolved from nonverbal pointing and pantomiming in apes
- Human verbal communication adds collaboration, not just requests (Tomasello, 2010)
- Important element: referential intention (what the speaker intends to communicate)

**Structure of Verbal Collaborative Behavior: Grice's Maxims**

- Cooperative principle: speaker implicates intended meaning, and listener inquires for understanding
- Four maxims ensure meaningfulness in collaborative discourse
  - Quality: accurate, genuine, and well-evidenced communication
  - Quantity: right amount of information about shared topic
  - Relevance: content stays close to referential intention and topic
  - Manner: clear, unambiguous, and orderly expression

**Collaborative Verbal Communication in Children's Development**

- Collaborative verbal communication evolves from daily routines between child and parent
- Central to this process is the development of grammatical conventions (Tomasello, 2010)
  - Grammar of requesting: combinations of pointing and language
  - Grammar of informing: multigestural combinations identifying objects and information
  - Grammar of sharing: use of narratives to share experiences

**Origins of Human Communication (Tomasello, 2010)**

- Cooperative communication is a fundamental aspect of human communication
- Shared intentionality is necessary for collaborative activities
- Cooperative infrastructure evolved as part of larger human adaptation for cooperation and cultural life
- Pointing and pantomiming were critical transition points in the evolution of human communication
- Conventional languages arose by piggybacking on these already understood gestures

**Human Communication is Cooperative (Tomasello, 2010)**

- Human communication operates naturally within contexts of:
  - Mutually assumed common conceptual ground
  - Mutually assumed cooperative communicative motives
- Shared intentionality is necessary for engaging in uniquely human forms of collaborative activity
- Cooperative communication arose as a way to coordinate collaborative activities more efficiently

**Collaborative Communication and Evolution (Tomasello, 2010)**

- Cooperative communication emerged as part and parcel of the evolution of humans' unique forms of collaborative activity
- During children's development, collaborative language evolves in the context of daily collaborative routines between child and parent
- Central to this process is the development of grammatical conventions

**Grice's Maxims (Grice, 1989)**

- Cooperative principle: speaker implicates intended meaning, and listener inquires for understanding
- Four maxims ensure meaningfulness in collaborative discourse
  - Quality: accurate, genuine, and well-evidenced communication
  - Quantity: right amount of information about shared topic
  - Relevance: content stays close to referential intention and topic
  - Manner: clear, unambiguous, and orderly expression

**Politeness Principles in Conversation (Leech, 1983)**

- Six politeness standards or maxims in modern Western culture
  - Tactful communication: minimizes cost, maximizes benefit to others
  - Generous communication: minimizes benefit to self, maximizes benefit to others
  - Approval: minimizes dispraise of others, maximizes praise and enhancement of others
  - Modesty: minimizes praise to self, maximizes praise to others
  - Agreement: minimizes disagreement, maximizes common interests and agreement
  - Sympathy: minimizes antipathy, maximizes listening to the needs of the other
- Positive opposite of toxic verbal communication

### An enormous amount of difficulty all through life arises from the fact that communicative behavior miscarries because words do not carry meaning, but 

**Communicative Difficulties and Sullivanian Therapy**

* Communicative behavior fails due to words not carrying meaning but evoking meaning instead
* Early Sullivanian therapists focused on enhancing collaborative verbal communication in treatment
* Importance of providing honest feedback when patient's communication doesn't make sense
* Mary Main and associates studied failures of collaborative verbal communication using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)

**Collaborative Verbal Communication and Grice's Maxims on AAI**

* Secure individuals exemplify collaborative behavior with truthful, adequate, relevant, and clear expression
* Insecure individuals show various types of noncollaborative verbal behavior:
  * Dismissing: numerous violations of quality (overgeneralizations, untruthful or contradictory statements, succinct descriptions)
  * Anxious-preoccupied: numerous violations of quantity, relevance, and manner (wandering off topic, adding too much information, vague and ambiguous statements)
  * Disorganized: numerous violations of all four maxims

**Collaborative Verbal Communication in Everyday Life and Psychotherapy**

* Securely attached individuals talk openly, patiently, clearly, stay on topic, evoke emotions appropriately, take responsibility, reflectively listen, and validate each other's perspectives
* Dismissing patients: talk too little, overly positive, intellectualized, avoid conflict, give ultimatums, make threats, argue from a fixed position
* Anxious-preoccupied patients: talk too much, interrupt, perseverate on topics, repeat points, demand listener's attention, use vague and ambiguous language, exhibit excessive verbal demands, complain, blame self or other
* Disorganized patients: confusing and contradictory mixture of dismissing and anxious-preoccupied behaviors, disorganized and incoherent speech, shifting dissociative states
* Therapist's role: provide feedback when communication doesn't make sense, help patient clarify and make more sense, ensure patient is aware of what was said during dissociative states.

### A Model for Collaborative Dialogue in Treatment

**Collaborative Dialogue in Psychotherapy: A Model by Karlen Lyons-Ruth**

* Based on observations of infant-caregiver interactions
* Focuses on developing representation of nonverbal, implicit experiences
* Two-person collaborative dialogue for facilitating developmental change

**Components of Collaborative Dialogue**

* Implicit relational level engagement
* Careful attention to intersubjective experience

**Eleven Steps for Establishing Collaborative Verbal Communication in Insecurely Attached Patients**

1. **Establish a verbal secure base:**
   * Reflective listening and validation
      - Manifest content
      - Affective meaning
      - Latent meaning
      - Consistency and depth
2. **Therapist's collaborative stance:**
   * Mutual exchange and collaboration through verbal exchange is important, welcome, and beneficial
3. **Explicit ground rules of verbal discourse:**
   * Make explicit the rules for collaborative verbal dialogue
   * Dismissing patients: full disclosure, no censorship
   * Soft-spoken behavior: speak loudly and clearly
4. **Encourage reflection:**
   * Encourage patients to reflect on their inner process
   * Help patients understand the importance of self-exploration
5. **Understand patient's attachment style:**
   * Adapt communication style based on patient's attachment style
6. **Repair ruptures:**
   * Repair communication breakdowns promptly and effectively
7. **Use metaphors and stories:**
   * Use metaphors and stories to facilitate understanding
8. **Encourage emotional expression:**
   * Create a safe space for emotional expression
9. **Maintain a nonjudgmental attitude:**
   * Avoid negative judgment and criticism
10. **Use open-ended questions:**
    * Encourage exploration through open-ended questions
11. **Provide structure and predictability:**
    * Offer a consistent, predictable therapeutic environment.

### In addition to sometimes letting the patient know verbally, as above, that we can’t hear what he or she is 255 saying, we find it useful at times to u

**Establishing Collaborative Verbal Communication**

1. *Signal for inaudible speech:* Use nonverbal signals, such as raising a hand or using metaphors, to help soft-spoken patients develop metacognitive awareness of their speech volume.
2. *Turn-taking:* Teach anxious-preoccupied patients the rules of turn-taking by pausing, allowing responses, and resuming speaking when the therapist has stopped talking. Use nonverbal signals to indicate violations of turn-taking.
3. **Metacognitive inquiries:** Explore with patients how they know they are being heard and what indicates listening, supporting them in moving beyond content into co-creation of a mutual connection.
4. **Secure base for verbal exchange:** Make explicit rules for communication, such as allowing patients to express uncertainty or ask questions, and encouraging clarification from the therapist.
5. **Observing problematic patterns:** Collaboratively observe and list violations of verbal collaboration with the patient, modeling cooperative activity and supporting metacognitive awareness.
6. **Ameliorating dysfunctional patterns:** Identify and target specific dysfunctional verbal exchange patterns, primarily through intervention and determination of attachment pattern (secure, dismissing, anxious-preoccupied, or disorganized).

* Soft-spoken patients:* Use nonverbal signals to indicate inaudible speech and help them develop metacognitive awareness.
* Anxious-preoccupied patients:* Teach turn-taking rules and use nonverbal signals for violations.
* Metacognitive inquiries:* Explore how patients know they are being heard and what indicates listening.
* Secure base for verbal exchange:* Make explicit rules for communication, allowing uncertainty and questioning.
* Observing problematic patterns:* Collaboratively list violations of verbal collaboration.
* Ameliorating dysfunctional patterns:* Identify and target specific dysfunctional verbal exchange patterns through intervention.

### Since dismissing patients typically show a normal capacity for exploration except around attachment themes, it is important that the therapist encoura

**Attachment-Based Therapy for Dismissing and Preoccupied Patients**

**Dismissing Patients:**

* Normal capacity for exploration except around attachment themes
* Encourage exploration of attachment themes
* Overly succinct and unemotional discourse
* Validate positive experiences, then encourage exploration of negative ones
* Idealize attachment figures, put positive spin on negative experiences
* Mark any affect that appears during exploration

**Interaction with Dismissing Patients:**

* Express interest and give feedback for more information
* Invite patient to describe underlying emotional experience
* Encourage exploration of full range of early attachment experiences
* Mark any affect that appears during exploration

**Preoccupied Patients:**

* Speak on and on, wander off topic
* Use "stop-action technique" for pauses and reflection
* Fear losing contact without ongoing speaking
* Encourage exploration in general and of canned or wandering discourse
* Unclear or ambiguous expressions require experiential focusing and clear description
* Undeveloped sense of self, overly concerned about other's state of mind

**Interaction with Preoccupied Patients:**

* Use "stop-action technique" for pauses and reflection
* Guide patient to attend to immediate felt experience
* Build ability to bring attention to internal states
* Use anchoring scales to direct focus away from others to self
* Mark any affect that appears during exploration
* Redirect attention and mark affect when describing past experiences.

### The seventh step entails identifying and modifying toxic noncollaborative verbal behavior. For the dismissing patient, toxic verbal behavior typically

**Step 7: Identifying and Modifying Toxic Noncollaborative Verbal Behavior**

* For Dismissing Patient: derogation, invalidation, ultimatums, themes of devaluation and toxic shaming
* For Preoccupied Patient: excessive blaming of self and others, excessive demands or imperatives, self-defeating thinking, overreaction in the face of conflict, frequent "mind-reading"
* Therapist gives immediate feedback on toxic discourse and explores underlying attachment themes
* Co-construct positive opposite of observed toxic verbal behavior
	+ Dismissing derogation: "I deeply value the depth of my connection with you"
	+ Preoccupied excessive blaming: correct focus to internal self-experience, create healthy need statements, offer appreciation instead of blame
* Patients benefit from Leech's (1983) six maxims of politeness in imagination

**Step 8: Therapist's Verbal Match-and-Change**

* Dismissing patient: reflectively mirror and develop content, mark underlying feelings
* Preoccupied patient: call for pause, summarize main point, request clearer communication, highlight severe violations of manner and ask for "best-fit" words.

### The ninth step entails enhancing verbal contingency communication and dialogue. Patients with insecure attachment need to see directly and frequently 

**Step 9: Enhancing Verbal Contingency Communication and Dialogue**

* Patients with insecure attachment need to see the impact of their verbal communication on others.
* Reflective listening and mirroring by the therapist is the first step in showing the patient that their communication has had an effect.
* Therapist gives feedback on the immediate effect of the patient's communication on their state of mind.
* Feedback can be given nonverbally or verbally, showing emotional impact or expressing thoughts arising from the patient's communication.
* Frequent naming of effects helps the patient understand the contingency between their words and the therapist's response.

**Step 10: Enhancing Patient's Metacognitive Awareness of Discourse Violations**

* Therapist addresses violations in quality, quantity, and relevance of speech.
* Asks questions to increase patient's awareness of discourse violations.
* Helps patient stay on topic and be aware of irrelevancies.

**Step 11: Collaborative Co-constructed Meaning-making**

* Focuses on the content of verbal discourse.
* Therapist helps patient clarify primary referential intention.
* Develops a back-and-forth interaction to explore and shape understanding.
* Helps patient formulate own experience.
* Co-created meaning-making starts with focus on current states and situations, later develops into a coherent life narrative.

**Signs of Successful Activation of the Collaborative Behavioral System**

* Nonverbal behaviors become matched, synchronized, and contingently effective.
* Verbal communication follows normal rules of collaborative discourse.
* Verbal communication is sensible and meaningful, following Grice's maxims with few violations.
* Verbal communication is coherent and scores 7-9 on the AAI.
* Verbal communication is contingently effective on the listener.
* Patient monitors lapses in verbal discourse accurately and ongoing.

**Outcomes of Successful Treatment**

* Healthy nonverbal and verbal communication in everyday conversation.
* Capacity for healthy, meaningful, coherent, and contingently effective communication.
* Direct experience of benefits and rewards of healthy communication with others.
* Overcoming developmental arrest of the collaborative behavioral system.

### Case Illustration The transcript below is from a session with a man in his 30s. “John” had presented for therapy for symptoms of depression and low se

**Case Illustration: John's Therapy Sessions**

**Background**
- John, a man in his 30s, presented for therapy with symptoms of depression and low self-esteem.
- Assessed as having a mixed attachment style, predominantly anxious-preoccupied with some dismissing features.
- Struggles with rapid speech and fading slurs at the end of sentences, making it difficult for therapist to understand him.

**Session Excerpt**
- Therapist notices John's speaking patterns and asks him to slow down and clarify.
- John acknowledges his fast speech developed as a kid to avoid attention or criticism.
- Therapist suggests John take time with what he says, breathe deeply, and enunciate clearly.
- John expresses difficulty handling a conflict at work with a co-worker (Jake).
- Both found each other stressful; communication was noncollaborative.

**Therapist's Approach**
- Maintains positive, collaborative engagement.
- Points out nonverbal and verbal lapses in collaboration with interest and acceptance.
- Encourages John to translate nonverbal signals into clear, collaborative comments.

**Impact on Treatment**
- Enhances understanding through effective communication.
- Increases John's metacognitive awareness of his communication patterns.
- Reflects the interdependence of effective communication and attachment security in treatment.

### PART IV TYPE-SPECIFIC TREATMENT Application of The Three Pillars Treatment To Dismissing, Anxious-Preoccupied, and Disorganized Attachment

**Part IV: Type-Specific Treatment**

* Application of The Three Pillars Treatment to: Dismissing, Anxious-Preoccupied, Disorganized Attachment

**Dismissing Attachment**

* Developmental care-receiving experiences: Minimization or denial of need for comfort and connection
* Tailoring the three pillars:
  * **Secure Base:** Validate feelings and needs, offer emotional support
  * **Challenges:** Address dismissive defenses, explore attachment injuries
  * **Repair:** Practice emotional communication and expression

**Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

* Developmental care-receiving experiences: Fear of abandonment or rejection, anxiety about relationship closeness
* Tailoring the three pillars:
  * **Secure Base:** Provide consistent presence and emotional responsiveness
  * **Challenges:** Address anxious defenses, explore attachment injuries
  * **Repair:** Practice emotional regulation and secure attachment behaviors

**Disorganized Attachment**

* Developmental care-receiving experiences: Unpredictable or contradictory caregiving, confusion about attachment needs
* Tailoring the three pillars:
  * **Secure Base:** Establish safety and predictability, provide clear communication
  * **Challenges:** Address disorganized defenses, explore attachment injuries
  * **Repair:** Practice emotional regulation and secure attachment behaviors

**General Considerations**

* Treatment is individualized to the patient
* Understanding specific developmental experiences guides treatment approaches
* The Three Pillars of Treatment are adapted based on each patient's needs.

### CHAPTER 11 Treating Dismissing Attachment The Origins of Dismissing Attachment

**Chapter 11: Treating Dismissing Attachment**

**Origins of Dismissing Attachment**

* Ainsworth et al. (1978) identified repeated maternal rejection as the origin of avoidant attachment in children.
* Mothers of avoidant children were described as especially rejecting, particularly during physical contact.
* Rejection communication included direct and indirect expressions of negative affect and behavior.
* Avoidant children often failed to show collaborative nonverbal behaviors like head-turning and gaze fixing on the parent.
* Main and Weston (1981) confirmed that repeated rejection is related to avoidant attachment development.
* Mothers of avoidant children were less emotionally expressive than secure or other insecure attachment types.

**Characteristics of Dismissing Mothers**

* Selectively misattuned to negative affects, especially when directed toward them.
* Comfortable attuning to positive affect and play.
* Rejecting of children's bids for comfort and reassurance.
* Use comments to override babies' affect.
* Misattunement likely reflects the mother's internal state and needs.

**Therapeutic Stance with Dismissing Patients**

* Underrepresented in clinical settings, often seek treatment for reasons other than relational dissatisfaction.
* When presenting with relational disturbance, attribute source to others' behavior.
* Consistent positive engagement by therapist is crucial for reactivating attachment system.
* Careful, accurate attunement to patient-initiated proximity- and contact-seeking, verbal expressions of felt needs, and negative affects.
* Permissive encouragement of exploration of attachment experiences, including past and current relationships.
* Support the emergence and experience of negative affect related to attachment.
* Encourage free exploration of self in the context of attachment relationships.

### Using Ideal Parent Figure Imagery With the Dismissing Patient

**Ideal Parent Figure Imagery with Dismissing Patients**

**Ideal for early phase treatment**
- Structures sessions on attachment themes
- Allows relational distance from therapist
- Less threatening than here-and-now relationship

**Benefits of Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) imagery**
- Transforms unrealistic idealization into healthy internal working model
- Acceptable to patient due to strong parental idealization

**Challenges and initial reactions**
- Patient may feel bewilderment or threat
  * Opportunity for therapist to help identify missing sense of secure attachment
- Patient may become fearful
  * Therapist helps patient understand attachment as a source of threat
- Collaborative interaction between patient and therapist

**Closeness/distance regulation**
- For patients unable to tolerate proximity with IPFs
- Imagery includes experimenting with closeness and distance
- Patient learns self-regulation and control in imagery

**Considerations when working with IPF imagery**
1. Shaping elements of IPF imagery based on research
   - Emphasize deep acceptance and encouragement of attachment behavior
2. Tailoring IPF imagery to suit particular dismissing patient
- Co-created spontaneously in ongoing collaborative interaction

**Characteristics of imagined ideal parent figures**
- Deeply accepting and encouraging of child's attachment behavior
- Welcoming and open to physical and emotional contact
- Never uncomfortable with closeness or distance as desired by the child.

### Over time, the goal is to transform the approach/avoidance conflict regarding attachment needs into a stable, positive representation of parent figure

**Secure Attachment:** The goal is to transform the approach/avoidance conflict regarding attachment needs into a stable, positive representation of parent figures who are deeply accepting and encouraging of the child's attachment needs.

**Imagery Process:** Patients are helped to imagine ideal parents (IPFs) who are attuned and contingently responsive to their emotional states, including underlying vulnerabilities and deeper emotional themes. IPFs stay with the patient during uncomfortable moments instead of turning away.

**Dismissing Patients:** Specific considerations for dismissing patients include:

- Encouraging identification and expression of negative emotions, especially vulnerabilities and deeper feelings.
- Introducing open, flexible, and permissive IPFs to help the patient positively remap their internal working models (IWMs).

**General Considerations for IPF Imagery:**

- Parental presence, consistency, reliability, and interest.
- Protection: IPFs provide protection specifically in the attachment relationship.
- Attunement: IPFs are attuned to physical and emotional proximity-seeking and a wide range of negative emotions.

**IPF Imagery for Dismissing Patients:**

- Protection: IPFs protect the patient in the attachment relationship.
- Attunement: IPFs are especially attuned to negative emotional expressions and welcome physical and emotional closeness.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Repeatedly shape and reshape the imagery to provide optimal discomfort for the patient, neither too little nor too much.
- Introduce corrective IPF imagery that contributes to the development of positive representations and expectancies of others being comfortable with negative emotions.

### Third, with respect to soothing, the therapist suggests scenes in which the child is emotionally upset and the IPFs are consistently responsive to the

**Attachment-Based Therapy for Dismissing Patients**

1. **Soothing:** Therapist suggests scenes where IPFs (ideal parent figures) respond consistently to child's emotional upset with soothing, comfort, and reassurance to develop a stable, positive representation of others as open and normal sources of comfort.
   - Child experiences emotional upset in scene.
   - IPFs tune in and find ways to soothe effectively.

2. **Expressed Delight:** Caregivers of dismissing patients typically lacked expression of delight or selectively expressed it around child's independence. Imagery is used to support the experience of IPFs expressing genuine delight about emotional expressions and desire for closeness.
   - IPFs are delighted when child wants to be close and share feelings.
   - They welcome all feelings, even uncomfortable ones.

3. **Fostering Best Self-Development:** Early childhood caregivers reinforced independent self by selectively attuning to exploratory behavior, contributing to maladaptive belief that self is best apart from relationship. IPF imagery introduces secure base for exploration.
   - Child explores with IPFs as a secure base.
   - They support exploration while providing consistent encouragement and safety.

4. **Individualizing IPF Protocol:** Use adjectives or phrases from AAI (Adult Attachment Interview) to individualize IPF protocol by translating negative descriptions into positive opposites for genuine, not false-positive imagery.
   - Translate unrealistic, idealized parental relationship descriptions into their genuine, positive opposites.
   - Use these positive opposites in IPF imagery to address what was lacking in the early childhood relationships.

5. **Case Illustration:** A dismissing patient's descriptions of his parents were unrealistically idealized and positive. The therapist translated these into genuine positive opposites for use in IPF imagery:
   - Mother: From "loving" to "deeply physically affectionate," from "orderly routines" to "savoring moments together," from "concerned" to "always attuned to your needs," and from "helpful" to "deeply attuned to your needs and feelings."
   - Father: From "around a lot" to "carefully attuned to your needs and feelings," from "plays with me" to "enhancing sense of self," from "strong" to "trusting your longings," from "caring" to "the fun of just being together and not doing anything," and from "learning" to "fostering the joy of discovering and learning."

### Fostering Collaboration in the Dismissing Patient

**Fostering Collaboration in Treating Dismissing Patients**

* Dismissing patients resist engagement on attachment themes due to deactivated attachment system
* Early focus is on engaging cooperative behavioral system for collaboration and teamwork
* Therapist introduces shared goals and mutual understanding of treatment issues
* Foundation: both patient and therapist need to show up emotionally as well as physically
* Self-exploration in therapy occurs within the context of a relationship
* Collaborative agreement and interaction around IPF method reduces resistance
* Address noncollaborative nonverbal behavior:
  * Dismissing patients may sit far away, rarely turn head, frequently avert gaze
  * Therapist uses metacognitive awareness to help patient become aware of nonverbal behaviors
  * Experiential focusing identifies state of mind associated with nonverbal gesture
* Focus on contingently matching and transforming affective facial displays
* Dismissing adults violate Grice's maxim of truthful quality and quantity in discourse about attachment themes
* Therapist calls attention to overly positive, succinct, or lacking verbal communication
* Encourage patient to explore underlying emotions, memories, assumptions, and maladaptive schemas associated with attachment themes.

### Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in the Dismissing Patient

**Metacognitive Skills Development for Dismissing Patients**

* Therapist's consistent reflective stance contributes to metacognitive skills development (Allen, 2001, 2013)
* Specific techniques like affect marking and experiential focusing are effective

**Metacognitive Identification of Internal States**

* Dismissing patients have poor metacognitive identification of internal states
* Use simple anchoring scales to enhance awareness (1-10 scale for degree of awareness)
* Scales can show dismissing patients how little they are aware of their inner state
* Exploration of states of mind becomes a primary treatment goal

**Affect and Underlying Vulnerabilities**

* Dismissing patients resist accessing negative and positive affects, especially in relation to attachment experience
* Encourage patients to look beyond surface-level experience to deeper levels
* Use affect dial technique to promote staying with resisted states
* Patients learn to identify specific emotions and experience them fully
* Experiential focusing helps develop metacognitive identification in general

**Marked Affectivity and Contingent Responsiveness**

* Mentalization-based treatment emphasizes marked affectivity and contingent responsiveness
* Marked affectivity: therapist mirrors patient's affect using a verbal intensifier
* Encourages metacognitive identification of state of mind
* Fosters awareness of contingent responsiveness
* Patients learn to imagine ways they directly affect IPF responses and notice the effect on their inner state

**Metacognitive Awareness of Context**

* Dismissing patients have poor awareness of contingency effects
* Encourage metacognitive awareness of contextual factors (life circumstances, history)
* Patients recognize specific ways early parental rejection affected them
* Develop rueful recognition of negative ways they have become like their parents
* Later in treatment, encourage taking a wider perspective to articulate a central guiding purpose or ultimate concern.

### Stages in the Treatment of the Dismissing Patient

**Stages in the Treatment of the Dismissing Patient**

1. **Introducing Cooperative Behavior:**
   - Therapist introduces concept of cooperative behavior as a way to work on reactivating attachment system indirectly.
   - Use of IPF imagery and addressing nonverbal and verbal misattunements.
   - Encouraging metacognitive awareness during misattunements.

2. **Reactivation of Attachment System:**
   - Longing for relationship connection reappears in successful treatment.
   - Patients value attachment, long for closeness despite defenses.
   - Longing is accompanied by anxiety, sadness, shame, and vulnerability.
   - Movement from avoidant or fearful to secure attachment involves ambivalence.
   - Normalizing interventions to address toxic shame.
   - IPF imagery focuses on accepting, soothing parent figures.

3. **Clear Signs of Attachment System Reactivation:**
   - Nonconflicted reports of proximity-seeking and contact-seeking between child and IPFs.
   - Preference for using IPF imagery.
   - Spontaneous comments about preferring therapist's presence.
   - Emergence of healthy protest behavior at therapist's unavailability.
   - Therapeutic ruptures likely to occur due to deactivated attachment system towards the therapist.
   - Collaborative metacognitive inquiry into patient and therapist states of mind during treatment ruptures.

4. **Middle to Late Stages of Treatment:**
   - Dismissing patient capable of using therapist as a secure base.
   - Focus on exploration of secure intimacy, not early childhood attachment themes.
   - Use of ideal partner imagery to develop stable, positive map for adult secure intimacy.
   - Ideal intimate partners provide safety, responsiveness, secure base, safe haven, contingent responsiveness, comfort, and encouragement of self-development within the context of intimacy.

### Case Illustration

**Case Illustration: Dismissing Attachment Style**

- Patient was a successful businessman in his early 50s with a dismissing attachment style (Ds3)
- Married and divorced after a short-term relationship, never had an intimate gay relationship, only hired escorts for physical contact
- Initially came to treatment for being overweight and developed chronic low self-esteem despite success
- First treatment focused on enhancing self-esteem and metacognitive awareness to manage binge eating
- After a year, patient lost weight and resolved chronic low self-esteem issues
- Terminated treatment after therapist suggested addressing absence of close relationships
- Returned two years later due to weight gain and diabetes diagnosis

**Second Treatment: Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Imagery**

- Patient reported patterns of emotional eating at the start of second session
- Tried using IPF imagery independently during the week

*Transcript from the second session:*

**Patient:** I tried to use the IPF imagery on my own, but it didn't really work. It felt kind of artificial. [_The patient is expressing a dismissive attitude towards the IPF imagery._]

**Therapist:** (Empathically) I understand that it might feel artificial at first, but as we continue to practice, it can become more natural and effective. [_The therapist acknowledges the patient's feelings and offers reassurance._]

**Patient:** But I don't really see how it applies to me. I mean, I've been successful in my business and my life. I don't need anyone else to make me feel secure. [_The patient is expressing a common dismissive belief that they don't need attachment._]

**Therapist:** (Reflectively) It seems like you have a strong sense of independence and self-sufficiency, which is great. However, even successful people can benefit from feeling securely attached to others. [_The therapist validates the patient's feelings while introducing the importance of attachment._]

**Patient:** I guess that makes sense, but it still feels a bit strange. [_The patient remains hesitant._]

**Therapist:** (Gently) It's normal to feel uncomfortable with new things, especially when they challenge our beliefs or ways of thinking. But remember, we're not asking you to change who you are; we're just exploring the possibility of adding a new tool to your emotional toolbox. [_The therapist reassures the patient and emphasizes the voluntary nature of the exercise._]

**Patient:** I see what you mean. Maybe I can give it another try. [_The patient is open to considering the IPF imagery further._]

### Therapist: When you feel the need to emotionally eat, you use the ideal parent figures to comfort you? But earlier you talked about some discomfort ab

**Therapy Session:**

**Patient's Emotional Eating and Attachment:**

* Patient uses ideal parent figures for emotional comfort during therapy but feels uncomfortable with it.
* Metacognitive awareness of the process: patient is more comfortable utilizing techniques at home, but feels uneasy in the therapeutic relationship.

**Metacognitive Awareness:**

* Patient shows metacognitive awareness of their state of mind and limitations of knowledge.
* Patient experiences metacognitive monitoring of immediate state of mind during therapy session.

**Underlying Vulnerability:**

* Patient feels deeply uncomfortable with being seen or having someone be interested in them, fearing it may not be genuine.
* This fear stems from a negative attachment experience in the past.

**Imagery Exercise:**

* Therapist introduces imagery exercise to help patient imagine ideal parents and the qualities that would make them comforting and non-threatening.
* Patient struggles with generating positive images, focusing on absence of emotion and instrumental tasks instead.

**Positive Parental Responsiveness:**

* Patient spontaneously introduces the idea of positive parental responsiveness during imagery exercise.
* Therapist encourages patient to continue exploring the theme of emotional closeness with ideal parents.

### Therapist: The scene will change, and in the next scene you will learn something more about preferring the closeness without being threatened by it . 

**Session Overview:**

* The patient describes a scene of positive proximity-seeking with responsive Insecurely Attached Figures (IPFs) in the park.
* Therapist introduces the concept of positive expectancy about IPFs' responsiveness.
* Patient shows metacognitive awareness of unresponsiveness of family-of-origin parents and attachment approach/avoidance struggle.
* In a subsequent session, the patient discusses overeating and mindless eating during reading.
* Therapist fosters metacognitive awareness of state of mind and relating variables.
* Patient shows metacognitive awareness of deactivation of attachment and illusion of self-sufficiency.
* Patient expresses dislike for imagined tenderness and support, but wonders if it could be easier to imagine.
* Therapist introduces positive IPF imagery around emotional closeness.

**Positive Proximity-Seeking:**

* Scene in the park with responsive IPFs.
* Patient seeks closeness without feeling threatened.
* Quality of IPFs' responsiveness helps patient want closeness.
* Patient collaboratively generates positive imagery to counteract rejection experiences.

**Metacognitive Awareness:**

* Patient shows awareness of unresponsiveness of family-of-origin parents and attachment approach/avoidance struggle.
* Therapist fosters metacognitive awareness of state of mind and relating variables.
* Patient makes a connection between lingering and filling the void of attachment needs.
* Patient discovers a connection between binge eating and longing for connection.

**Imagery and Emotional Closeness:**

* Therapist introduces positive IPF imagery around emotional closeness.
* Patient initially resists the idea, but wonders if it could be easier to imagine in certain conditions.

### Therapist: Let’s see what the conditions might be under which you could allow this? So go ahead and imagine just the right conditions under which you 

**Treating a Patient with Dismissing Attachment:**

**Persistent Active Engagement:** The therapist takes an active stance towards the patient's protests and attempts to deactivate attachment behavior, using imagery of ideal parent figures (IPFs) as the main approach.

**Imagery of Ideal Parent Figures:** The therapist asks the patient to imagine the conditions under which they could allow themselves to feel a supportive, tender, loving connection with IPFs. This helps the patient discover that positive remapping of childhood IPF attachment works better than imagery of physical and emotional closeness in current relationships.

**Metacognitive Identification:** The therapist fosters metacognitive identification in the patient of their discomfort with attachment closeness, helping them understand their limitations and emotions.

**Observable Changes:** In just two sessions, the patient shows recognition and experience that attachment longings are not a source of threat and shame but can be a source of security and satisfaction. They begin developing a new, positive internal working model (IWM) of attachment, including comfort with physical closeness, being deeply seen and known, soft emotions, and spontaneous exploration in the context of secure attachment.

**Early Signs of Normalization:** The patient summarizes these positive changes as "lingering with the blissfulness of being together" and shows early signs of shifting towards finding this blissful lingering in the context of an attachment relationship instead of with eating behaviors.

**Main Features of Treating a Patient with Dismissing Attachment:**

- Persistent active engagement from therapist
- Imagery of ideal parent figures who are consistently responsive to the patient-as-child
- Fostering metacognitive identification in the patient
- Developing a new, positive IWM of attachment
- Early signs of normalization of attachment longings.

### CHAPTER 12 Treating Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment

**Chapter 12: Treating Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

**Origins of Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

* Developed from various forms of maternal unresponsiveness (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Belsky, 1999b; Mikulincer et al., 2003; Shaver & Mikulincer, 2009)
* Mothers were inconsistent and unpredictable in responding to infants' signals of distress
* Poor timing of responsiveness and partial attention due to multitasking
* Inconsistent responsiveness contributed to anxious preoccupation
* Selective misattunement to infant's exploratory initiatives and expressions of exuberance
* Anxious-preoccupied mothers often anxious in caregiving context and spilled their anxieties onto infants

**The Therapeutic Stance with the Anxious-Preoccupied Patient**

* Focus on patient's own state of mind and self-experience (inside-out orientation)
* Reverse patient's outside-in orientation by collaborating to focus on internal states
* Consistently attuned and responsive to moment-by-moment shifting affective states (vitality affects)
* Fully present, moment-to-moment with the patient
* Limited therapist self-disclosure to avoid reactivating hyperactivating style within transference
* Self-disclosure should orient patient towards own state of mind during ruptures in therapeutic alliance.

### What’s it like for you now, hearing what I just said? Third, since research suggests that caregivers of children who have become anxious-preoccupied a

**Working with Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**

1. **Therapeutic Stance:**
   * Therapist does not selectively attune to patient's fear states or self-disclose own concerns.
   * Becomes a consistently calming presence, providing protection, reassurance, and metacognitive support.
   * Focuses on closeness–distance regulation using protective bubble imagery.
2. **Protective Bubble:**
   * Patient imagines a clear, safe, protective bubble.
   * Adjusts the size and position of the bubble to regulate closeness and distance.
   * Helps patients learn voluntary control over closeness–distance regulation and emotions.
3. **Exploratory Behavior:**
   * Therapist selectively attunes to patient's exploratory behavior and self-development.
   * Mirrors and encourages self-observations and expressions of interest.
   * Introduces direct inquiry to prompt and reinforce self-exploration.
4. **Working with Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Imagery:**
   * Anxious-preoccupied patients find it easier to use IPF imagery due to dissatisfactions with family-of-origin parents.
   * Introduction of IPF imagery may invoke threat, loyalty issues, and abandonment fear.
   * Therapist explains that imagination creates new possibilities while acknowledging the importance of actual parents.
   * Encourages patients to add positive qualities from their actual parents and use free imagination for ideal parent figures.
5. **IPF Imagery Considerations:**
   * Emphasize pervasive attunement and accurate contingent responsiveness in IPFs.
   * Tailor IPF imagery to the particular preoccupied patient, avoiding canned scripts.
   * Cultivate spontaneity in patients' lives through collaborative creation of IPF imagery.

### The creative process of the imagery allows for the possibility of very careful attunement each moment, in contrast to the pervasive misattunement to w

**Imagery Therapy for Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**

* The imagery process allows for attunement between patient (as child) and ideal parent figures (IPFs), contrasting with past misattunements.
* IPFs are attuned to the child's states, initiatives, and emotional expressions, providing recognition, acceptance, and appropriate responses.
* IPFs address over-involvement by being fully present and focused on the child.
* Consistent attunement reduces hypervigilance towards IPFs' states and experiences.

**Addressing Anxious Hyperarousal**

* Ideal parent figures are consistently attuned to and soothe the child's general anxiety and specific shifts towards high anxious arousal.
* Patients experience relief from burden of caretaking or controlling IPFs' responses.

**Addressing Hyperactivation of Attachment Behavior**

* Ideal parent figures accept and comfort the child when fearing disconnection or abandonment.
* Patients learn to feel secure in their connection with IPFs, reducing excessive attachment behavior.

**Interventions for Rapidly Escalating Abandonment Threat**

* Therapist suggests focusing on fear of abandonment and feeling more distressed to experience IPFs' attunement and effective responses.
* Patients describe how IPFs help them feel better, reinforcing inside-out orientation.

**Minimizing Self-Reference**

* Therapist avoids self-reference during sessions to reduce outside-in orientation and reinforce inside-out orientation.
* Validation and reinforcement of patient's inner states through affective marking.

**Separation and Reunion Episodes**

* Patients imagine brief separations from IPFs followed by reunions with appropriate responses during reunion episodes.
* Patients freely describe their experiences to enhance inside-out orientation.

### Working with IPF imagery in these specific ways will over time further reduce hyperactivated attachment behavior and promote attachment security and t

**IPF Imagery for Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**

IPF imagery is used to reduce hyperactivated attachment behavior and promote attachment security in anxious-preoccupied patients. This type of therapy emphasizes the importance of parent figures who are:

* Protective and provide a safe haven
* Carefully attuned to the patient's behaviors, inner states, and developmental capacities
* Soothing, comforting, and reassuring
* Openly express delight and pleasure regarding the patient's exploratory behavior
* Comfortable with and supportive of the child's initiatives of exploration and discovery

Anxious-preoccupied patients are characterized by:

* Fearfulness and anxiety disorders
* Childhood ambivalent/resistant attachment with significant caregiver misattunement
* Inhibited self-development

IPF imagery is tailored to address these specific needs:

**Protection and Safety:**

* Introduce protective parent figures to promote positive remapping of attachment figures as a source of safety and protection.

**Attunement:**

* Shape IPF imagery to provide experiences of careful attunement, encouraging healthy exploratory behavior and the development of positive expectancies that others can accurately understand the patient's ongoing experience.

**Soothing and Comfort:**

* Emphasize soothing qualities to help patients develop a stable representation and set of expectancies that others can be openly comforting and demonstrate that hyperactivated attachment behaviors are unnecessary.

**Expressed Delight:**

* Encourage parent figures to openly express delight and pleasure regarding the patient's exploratory behavior to address the missing experience in anxious-preoccupied patients.

**Fostering Best Self-Development:**

* Emphasize parent figures who are entirely comfortable with, deeply supportive of, and strongly confident about the child's initiatives of exploration and discovery to enable the developing child to find courage and tolerate fear and uncertainty in the face of new discoveries.

IPF imagery is tailored based on the patient's attachment interview or clinical interview to address their specific needs and experiences.

### Fostering Collaboration in Anxious-Preoccupied Patients

**Fostering Collaboration in Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**

* Anxious-preoccupied patients easily self-disclose, but it's not always a sign of collaboration
* Excessive self-disclosure is often an attempt to please and represents outside-in orientation
* Therapist should acknowledge disclosure and redirect focus to patient's experience

**Patient Interaction**

* Patient expresses worries and fears, feeling overwhelmed and exhausted
* Therapist acknowledges concerns and encourages exploration of feelings
* Redirects focus from external issues to internal experiences

**Nonverbal Behavior**

* Preoccupied patients cry easily, not always a positive sign of emotional release
* Frequent crying may indicate hyperactivation of attachment system
* Therapist should address underlying abandonment fears directly

**Nonverbal Attunement**

* Patient's nonverbal behavior is attuned to therapist but one-sided
* Therapist must transform patient's one-sided, outside-in nonverbal attunement into collaborative dialogue
* Develop experience of being attuned to nonverbally by the therapist

**Verbal Behavior**

* Anxious-preoccupied patients are verbally noncollaborative
* Talk on and on without pauses, fail to provide turn-taking opportunities
* Fail to meet basic rules of verbal coherence
* Therapist should highlight patient's failure to collaborate verbally
* Encourage conscious monitoring of speech and framing discourse in succinct meaningful units
* Use nonverbal indicators to signal when to bring discourse to a close
* Help patient become metacognitively aware of wandering off topic, irrelevancies, passive speech, and jargon
* Engage patient's cooperativeness to reexpress essential points clearly.

### Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in Anxious-Preoccupied Patients

**Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**

* Anxious-preoccupied patients have low reflective capacity, requiring a therapeutic approach that enhances general reflective capacity and targets specific metacognitive skill deficiencies.

**Therapist's Role:**

* Maintain consistent mentalizing stance to offset patient's hypervigilance.
* Help patient identify their own affect experiences and realize they originate from within.
* Bring metacognitive focus to the relativity of all states during times of fear of abandonment.
* Assist in determining effective action strategies for responding to emotional states.
* Teach impulse control through anticipating outcomes, developing action plans, and organizing behaviors.

**Metacognitive Skills Development:**

* Develop postformal metacognitive skills to modify maladaptive schemas of emotional deprivation and abandonment.
* Use techniques from schema therapy to bring underlying assumptions into awareness.
* Recognize and address low coherence or disorganization in patient's discourse.

**Metacognitive Awareness Enhancement:**

* Use anchoring scales to improve metacognitive awareness of organization or coherence of mind.
* Consistently ask patients about their relative degree of disorganization or organization at each session.
* Gradually help patients develop an overall present orientation by fostering metacognitive awareness of past and present orientation.
* Use anchoring scales to improve metacognitive awareness of self/other focus.
* Consistently ask patients about their relative degree of self-focus or other-focus at each session.
* Gradually help patients develop the capacity for collaborative exchange and exploration by enhancing self-awareness and reducing preoccupation with others' states of mind.

### Stages in the Treatment of the Anxious-Preoccupied Patient

**Stages in the Treatment of the Anxious-Preoccupied Patient**

1. **Initially:**
   - Introduce cooperative behavior to temper attachment system hyperactivation and reactivate exploratory behavior.
   - Use Interpersonal Process Recall (IPF) imagery with noninvolving, accurately attuned parent figures.
   - Emphasize soothing and reassurance to reduce overall anxious arousal and temper heightened arousal during abandonment fear episodes.

2. **Middle Stage:**
   - Focus on repairing ruptures in the therapeutic relationship caused by empathic failures or heightened abandonment fear.
   - Collaborate with the patient to understand their state of mind during hyperactivated attachment behavior episodes.
   - Encourage self-exploration and trust within the attachment relationship.

3. **Middle to Late Stages:**
   - Enhance self-development and self-esteem, focusing on a healthy exploratory system for mature growth.
   - Serve as a secure base for self-exploration.
   - Signs of progress: reduced hyperactivation, diminished preoccupation with past hurts, here-and-now focus, inside-out orientation, and reactivated exploratory system.

4. **Later Stages:**
   - Develop a positive Internal Working Model (IWM) for secure intimacy.
   - Use ideal partner imagery to emphasize noninvolving, accurately attuned partners who provide a secure base and encourage self-development within the context of intimacy.
   - Objective: create a stable, positive map for adult secure intimacy.

### As was noted in the introduction to this case, the Three Pillars treatment led to an increase of Helen’s coherence on the AAI transcript from a 2 to a

**Three Pillars Treatment Outcome for Helen**

- *Introduction:* Helen's coherence on AAI transcript improved from 2 to 8, and her attachment status shifted from disorganized (CC/E3/Ds1) to earned secure with some anxious-preoccupied features (F5).

**Manifesations of Insecure Strategies**

- Anxious-preoccupied features may resurface periodically at the outer ranges of secure attachment spectrum, especially at F1 and F5.
- More likely to occur during relationally intimate experiences, including psychotherapy interactions.
- Helen continued to exhibit some anxious-preoccupied features but significantly less so than during early treatment period.

**Factors Affecting Anxious-Preoccupied Patterns**

- Comorbid bipolar spectrum disorder made Helen vulnerable to high stress levels and disrupted sleep.
- In the face of challenges, she was susceptible to mood instability and reappearance of anxious-preoccupied patterns.

**Benefits of Secure Attachment**

- Enhanced coherence of mind and metacognitive capacities allowed Helen to recognize and regulate anxious-preoccupied states.
- Greater internal security enabled her to tolerate processing traumatic material from past.
- Improved ability to experience felt sense of self (interoception) was stabilizing and organizing for Helen.

**Importance of Interoception in BPD Treatment**

- Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often lack interoceptive abilities, focusing on reading others' feelings instead.
- New psychotherapies for BPD should aim to increase patients' interoception ability.
- Three Pillars model integrates interoceptive development into therapy process.

**Treatment Considerations for Disorganized Attachment with Anxious-Preoccupied and Dismissing Strategies**

- Focus of next chapter.

### CHAPTER 13 Treating Disorganized or Fearful Attachment

**Chapter 13: Treating Disorganized or Fearful Attachment**

**Origins of Disorganized or Fearful Attachment**

* Main and Solomon (1986) identified a fourth prototype of infant attachment called disorganized, characterized by contradictory attachment behaviors.
* Children with disorganized attachment lack a single, unified Internal Working Model (IWM) for attachment.
* Grossmann, Grossmann, and Waters (2005) differentiated the disorganized category into three subtypes: contradictory behaviors, goal-oriented behaviors lacking, and direct disorganization.
* Disorganized attachment may result from prolonged or repeated separations from caregivers (Chisholm, 1998; Solomon and George, 1999), maternal depression and alcoholism (Main and Solomon, 1990), frightening and frightened parental behavior (Main and Hesse, 1990), or unresolved states of mind in parents regarding past trauma, abuse, or loss (George and Solomon, 1996).
* Maternal dissociated behavior is a stronger predictor of infant disorganized attachment than frightening/frightened parental behavior (Schuengel et al., 1999).
* Unresolved states in parents can lead to pervasive misattunement, disruptive affective communication, and child maltreatment (Lyons-Ruth et al., 1999).
* Disorganized attachment occurs in seemingly normal families with little distinguishing mothers from those of secure, avoidant, or ambivalent children (Solomon and George, 1999).

**Characteristics of Children with Disorganized Attachment**

* Show multiple, contradictory attachment behaviors – both deactivating and hyperactivating.
* Have more dissociative experiences and behaviors than other children.
* Are often in states of unmitigated high-fear arousal.
* Show significantly greater negative emotional arousal than children with other attachment prototypes (Spangler and Grossmann, 1993).
* Have a poor capacity for affect regulation, contributing to chronic negative affect states.
* Display inhibited exploratory behavior and markedly impaired self-development (Solomon and George, 1999).

### The Therapeutic Stance With the Disorganized Patient

**Therapeutic Stance with Disorganized Patients:**

* Important for therapist to be a safe haven and not exacerbate fear
* Calming, soothing, reassuring presence
* Actively engaging but not involving in therapist's state of mind
* Comforting, fearless, confident, accepting, welcoming, determined, proactive
* Fully present, consistent, steady, predictable
* Consistently attuned to and nonverbally matching patient's affects
* Encourage and reinforce positive emotional expressions
* Careful not to interrupt patient's attachment displays

**Working with Ideal Parent Figures (IPF) Imagery:**

* Majority of disorganized patients have personality and/or dissociative disorders
* Rapid and marked shifting of states of mind and behaviors
* Each shifting behavior and state a spontaneous expression of attachment need
* Facilitate patient's experience of separate and unique set of IPFs for each shift
* DID patient may switch to fearful child state, imagine parents responsive to fear
* DID patient may switch to dismissing state, imagine engaging and responsive parents
* DID patient may switch to hostile-aggressive state, imagine parents who safely contain aggression
* For each significant behavioral or state shift, suggest new set of IPFs
* Patient's overall experience approximates continuous IPF responsiveness.

### Therapists of disorganized patients benefit from understanding the different forms of dissociation that such patients might manifest. Van der Hart, Ni

**Understanding Dissociation and Structural Dissociation**

- Van der Hart et al. (2004) argue for one type of dissociation: structural dissociation, which involves rigid compartmentalization of dissociative parts.
- Traditional treatment practices, such as calling forth and sending back alter personalities, reinforce this compartmentalization.
- Instead, therapists should ask alters to stay present after communication, allowing for multiple alters to be present during a session.

**Structuralizing Technique with IPFs**

- Originally developed for trauma processing with Multiple Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder (MPD/DID) patients.
- Adapted for working with disorganized patients on attachment-related themes.
- After working with one alter state, therapist invites other parts to come forward while the current part remains present.
- When a patient experiences a spontaneous structural dissociative shift, the therapist invites the previous part to remain present with ideal parents while the new part engages with them.

**IPF Imagery and Disorganized Attachment**

- Disorganized patients exhibit both deactivating and hyperactivating attachment strategies.
- IPFs provide a deep sense of security while being attuned to patient's fear and mistrust.
- Encourage both attachment behavior and exploratory behavior in the same interactive sequence.
- Address chronic-heightened fear arousal by shaping IPFs that are carefully attuned to the child's fear.
- Be fiercely protective but not intrusively protective of the patient-as-child.
- Stimulate the patient-as-child's full range of emotional arousal in intersubjective collaboration.

### Seventh, since many disorganized patients have learned to expect others to be dissociative and not present, IPFs are shaped to be fully present, consi

**Interpersonal Repair Facilitators (IPFs) for Disorganized Patients:**

**1. Fully Present and Attuned:**
- IPFs are fully present and attentively engaged with the patient-as-child.
- They provide a sense of reassurance through their consistent presence.

**2. Consistently Responsive:**
- IPFs respond accurately to the communications of the patient-as-child.
- They help patients feel seen, supported, and safe.

**3. Effective Limiting and Containment:**
- IPFs set appropriate limits during states of rage or hostile aggression.
- They help patients express intense emotions in safe ways.

**4. Consistency and Predictability:**
- IPFs provide a steady, reliable presence.
- Their consistent behavior helps disorganized patients regulate themselves.

**5. Provide Appropriate Structure:**
- IPFs offer just enough structure to help disorganized patients feel clear and coherent.

**Supporting Secure Attachment:**

**Protective IPFs:**
- Offer an approachable safe haven without fear arousal.
- Provide calmness and serenity.

**Attuned IPFs:**
- Consistently recognize and respond to the full range of negative and positive emotional states.
- Support intersubjective reciprocal exchange of vitality affects and categorical emotional states.

**Protection:**
- IPFs provide a safe haven, reducing fear arousal.
- They help patients feel protected from harm.

**Attunement:**
- IPFs respond accurately to the patient's emotional states.
- They support intersubjective understanding and emotional connection.

**Soothing:**
- IPFs help patients regulate their emotions and reduce distress.
- They provide comfort and reassurance during times of need.

**Expressed Delight:**
- IPFs express delight in the patient's positive qualities and achievements.
- They foster self-esteem and a sense of worth.

**Fostering Best Self-Development:**
- IPFs encourage patients to develop their best selves.
- They help patients build resilience and coping skills.

### Thereby, the disorganized patient-as-child learns to trust his or her affects and to become effective in expressing them in the context of the imagine

**Attachment-Focused Therapy (AFT) with Disorganized Patients:**

**Background:**

* AFT helps disorganized patients develop trust in affects and effective expression through imagined attachment relationship with IPFs.
* IPFs respond contingently to patient's attachment behaviors, supporting reactivation and balance of the attachment behavioral system.

**IPF Responsibilities:**

* Support proximity-and contact-seeking while ensuring safety.
* Soothe high-fear arousal through appropriate responses.
* Encourage self-development at every stage.
* Individualize IPF protocols based on five adjectives given in AAI.

**IPF Interaction with Disorganized Patients:**

* Respond effectively to problematic attachment behaviors, enabling healthy behavior activation.
* Help patients express positive emotions and prosocial emotions.
* Encourage self-development for a coherent, unitary sense of self.

**Example Interaction:**

* Patient expresses fear and desire for proximity.
* IPF responds by acknowledging feelings and encouraging safe expression.

**IPF Response to Adjectives in AAI:**

* Caring: Memories of nurturing actions.
* Nurturing: Specific examples of care shown.
* Torturous: Memories of traumatic experiences.
* Angry: Instances of yelling or conflict.
* Moody: Recollections of unpredictable behavior.

**IPF Interaction with Disorganized Patients' Family-of-Origin Parents:**

* Both a source of attachment need and support, and fear and threat.
* IPFs respond based on adjectives given in AAI to understand patient's experiences.

### The therapist translated the five adjectives for each parent into their positive opposites, which were then given to the ideal parent figures in the i

**Imaginal Reprepresentation (IPR) Therapy for Disorganized Patients**

* IPR therapy involves creating ideal parent figures based on positive opposites of family-of-origin parents.
* Ideal mother figure: deeply caring, nurturing, calm, soft-spoken, and steady.
* Ideal father figure: physically affectionate, serene, gentle, empowering, and protective.
* Therapist draws patient's attention to the effect of ideal parent figures on inner state.
* Consistent recognition of positive experiences contributes to organization of mind.

**Fostering Collaboration with Disorganized Patients**

* Clear, collaborative treatment-frame agreement necessary due to higher risk of treatment-frame violations.
* Nonverbal communication between disorganized patients and their infants shows significant differences and mismatches by four months.
* Therapist recognizes, acknowledges, and addresses negative-affective displays early in treatment.
* Collaborative help for patient to bring metacognitive awareness to nonverbal behaviors.
* Methods for collaboratively promoting communication described in relevant chapters.

**Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in Disorganized Patients**

* Reflective capacity or mentalizing skill is very low in disorganized patients.
* Importance of increasing patient's range of metacognitive skills.
* Disorganized patients show low coherence of mind and frequent state shifts.
* Use of disorganization/organization anchor scale to identify and master states.
* Developing specific metacognitive skills, such as recognizing current orientation and taking a wider perspective.

### Stages in the Treatment of the Disorganized Patient

**Stages in the Treatment of the Disorganized Patient**

1. **Collaborative Negotiation of a Mutually Agreed Upon Treatment Frame:**
   - Begin treatment with clear understanding of mutual expectations, responsibilities, and ground rules.
   - Address disruptions caused by noncollaborative behavior of disorganized patients.

2. **Establishing Attachment and Reducing Fear:**
   - Work to attenuate patient's fearfulness using ideal-parent-figure (IPF) work.
   - Introduce IPFs who provide safety without fear to fearful parts or self-states.
   - Normalize longing for attachment and reassure patient that it is okay to desire closeness.

3. **Addressing Dismissing Parts or Behaviors:**
   - Utilize IPF guidelines to engage and respond contingently to deactivated attachment systems.
   - Address shame, distress, and acting-out impulses with compassionate IPFs.

4. **Engaging Outlier Parts or Self-States:**
   - Use cooperative behavioral system when strong resistance is encountered from outlier parts.
   - Help patient form positive relationships between outlier parts and IPFs.

5. **Bringing All Parts Together:**
   - Call forth parts that need to feel securely attached, leaving each previous part present.
   - Decrease dissociation and foster unified sense of self around a central core self.

6. **Activating Exploratory Behavioral System:**
   - Use IPF imagery for patient to experience parent figures who encourage self-development.
   - Support healthy exploration with a secure base.

7. **Cultivating Postformal Metacognitive Skills and Developing Secure Adult Intimacy:**
   - Foster metacognitive awareness of mind organization, self/other orientation, past/present orientation, and child/adult orientation.
   - Encourage patient to articulate a clear, coherent life narrative.
   - Develop secure adult intimacy in the last phase of treatment.

### Case Illustration

**Case Illustration:** A patient with PTSD, major depression, and dissociative identity disorder (DID) underwent various treatment methods due to her complex trauma profile and childhood sexual abuse experiences.

**Background:** The patient's parents had significant issues – her mother was overly focused on appearance, and her father was an alcoholic minister who sexually abused her throughout her childhood and adolescence. She participated in an incest survivor group and individual phase-oriented trauma treatment to process the abuse memories and emotions.

**Treatment:** Initially, she responded well but later became increasingly dissociated, leading to a diagnosis of DID. The treatment was changed to attachment-based methods focusing on introducing Internal Parent Figures (IPFs) for safety and protection.

**First Phase:** IPFs were introduced to provide safety and connection, with the patient reporting a Wise Man as an initial IPF. She also reported needing IPFs who could stay with her during dissociative episodes.

**Second Phase:** As dissociation worsened, the therapist suggested IPFs for child parts, such as Whoopi Goldberg and the Dalai Lama, to address their fears and lack of understanding about secure attachment relationships.

**Session Transcript:** The patient switched between paranoid alters and vulnerable child parts during a therapy session. She felt alone, scared, and unable to distinguish past and current fears. The therapist acknowledged her feelings of vulnerability and fear and introduced IPF imagery around the theme of safety without fear.

**Patient's Response:** The patient initially resisted the idea of growing up in an ideal family but eventually began to imagine a secure connection with ideal parents, which helped alleviate her sense of deep aloneness and vulnerability.

**Conclusion:** The attachment-based treatment focused on introducing IPFs to provide safety, protection, and security for each part of the patient's dissociated identity. This approach helped address her feelings of fear, vulnerability, and deep aloneness.

**Resolution of Fear and Abusive Father**
- Patient's devil parts monitor and protect in dreams, chasing away the abusive father figure
- Therapist encourages compassion for the father through the lens of the Wise Man
- Patient reports feeling comfortable in the world and able to explore without fear.

**Metacognition and Organization of Mind**

* The patient is developing a metacognitive capacity to relate different states to each other
* Signs of this development include: noticing organization of mind, increased awareness during quiet moments, and feeling more stillness

**Fear of Change and Discovering New Coping Mechanisms**

* The fear of change and giving up old, dysfunctional ways of coping is overwhelming for the patient
* Therapist encourages exploration of new, healthier coping mechanisms and openness to discovery
* Patient begins to consider that there may be more to discover about themselves beyond their current understanding

**Expanding Awareness and Postformal Metacognition**

* The patient makes a connection between the expanding universe and their expanding awareness
* Therapist invites the patient to adopt a wider perspective, focusing on the vantage point of observation and the sense of self that is aware
* Patient considers the possibility that the wholeness they seek may already exist and that parts are getting in the way of its discovery
* The crystal metaphor illustrates the patient's discovery of a new, wider metacognitive perspective of awareness, leading to the unification of alter personality states into a wider whole.

### Therapist: To make it more concrete . . . what do the child parts look like from the perspective of the sun? What do the devil parts look like? The in

**Therapy Session:**

**Patient's Perspective on Internal Parts:**

- Sun (core self): bigger, greater, sense of completeness, central core
- Child parts: incomplete, jagged, peripheral
- Devil parts: disorganized, disorderly, jumbled
- Internalized father parts: ordering, organizing, quieting internal voices

**Metacognitive Perspective:**

- Fostering a wider perspective: seeing things from the sun's vantage point, certainty and clarity
- Metacognitive limits of knowledge: not always able to maintain this perspective, metacognition of organization of mind
- Reporting significant decrease in dissociation: more spontaneous, less outside-in orientation
- Metacognitive awareness: being aware of internal states and external situations, making choices, setting boundaries
- Enhanced metacognitive orientation: looking back on the past with greater awareness, focusing on the present moment
- Healthy sense of exploration of own mind: thinking about qualities of self, developing a unified sense of self.

**Patient's Progress:**

- Adopted wider perspective in a stable way
- Fear changing into wonder of discovery
- Resolved preoccupation with the past
- Greater overall awareness in daily life
- Less reactive
- Fluctuations in level of organization
- Developed metacognitive skills: holding self and other perspectives, focusing on future.

**Therapist's Interventions:**

- Fostering a wider perspective
- Encouraging metacognition of organization of mind
- Addressing metacognitive limits of knowledge
- Helping patient develop metacognitive skills: awareness, choice-making, setting boundaries.

### By the end of the fourth year of treatment, she was able to articulate many qualities of the newly emergent self: Patient: I was thinking about the ne

**Fourth Year of Psychotherapy Treatment:**

* Understood loneliness as a construction of the mind rather than a fixed state
* Noticed shift in awareness due to her dog's health issues and recognized its impact on presence, organization, and peace of mind
* Recognized that context affects her state of mind and made her vulnerable to external things
* Anticipated gaining greater control over her mind and being less vulnerable to external influences as she improved

**Metacognition:**

* Patient developed metacognitive awareness (thinking about thinking)
* Understood the relativity of negative states of mind
* Recognized loneliness as a construction of the mind
* Noticed the impact of context on her state of mind and organization
* Reflected on the differences between types of dissociation (nonawareness vs. disorganization)

**Therapist's Role:**

* Fostered metacognition by encouraging the patient to reflect on her thoughts and experiences
* Helped the patient understand the relativity of negative states of mind and loneliness
* Encouraged metacognitive awareness of contextual effects and the impact on her state of mind.

### Chapters 8, 9, and 10 describe in detail each of the three pillars of our treatment model, and Chapters 11, 12, and 13 present the specific considerat

**Three Pillars of Treatment Model: Overview**

- Chapters 8-10 describe the three pillars of the treatment model: relational disturbance determination, assessment of attachment problem, and engagement in collaborative dialogue (Source: Chapters 8-10)

**Relational Disturbance Determination**

- Identify nature of presenting problem: attachment, core conflictual relationship theme (CCRT), or trauma-bonding issue (Source: Chapter 8)
- Assess the degree of interference with relationships caused by mild to moderate anxious or dismissing attachment patterns (Source: Chapter 7)
- Determine primary disturbance based on developmental order and severity (Source: Chapter 8)

**Assessment of Attachment Problem**

- Use a variety of measures, including Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), Metacognition Assessment Scale (MAS), and Experience of Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire (Source: Chapters 3, 9, and 10)
- Determine attachment type and subtypes using AAI (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, disorganized) (Source: Chapter 10)
- Identify early childhood relationship patterns with each parent using AAI (Source: Chapter 10)
- Assess coherence of discourse and mind using AAI (Source: Chapter 10)
- Determine pre-treatment reflective functioning level using Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) (Source: Chapter 10)
- Identify condition-specific metacognitive deficits using MAS (Source: Chapter 10)

**Engagement in Collaborative Dialogue**

- Establish and prioritize shared treatment goals and a specific treatment plan (Source: Chapter 10)
- Use transparency model of treatment planning (Source: Chapter 7)
- Introduce Three Pillars approach and its rationale and methods (Source: Chapters 7 and 10)
- Provide psychoeducation about attachment using sample scripts for general information and specific insecure attachment subtypes (Source: Chapter 10)
- Introduce Ideal Parent Figure component of treatment during discussion of specific insecure attachment subtype (Source: Chapter 10)

### Psychoeducation About Attachment

**Attachment**

- Innate drive for healthy attachment relationship with parents or caregivers
- Secure attachment: child feels protected, safe, soothed, supported in exploration and independence
- Forms of insecure attachment:
  - Anxious: high anxiety, clingy, worried about parents' availability, limited learning and development
  - Avoidant: keeps emotional and physical distance, excessively explores independently, tends to be less emotionally attuned caregivers
  - Disorganized: combination of anxious and avoidant behaviors
- Internal working models or maps of attachment formed early in life (mostly during second year)
- Affect experiences with self and others throughout lifetime

**Dismissing Attachment**

- Parents did not fully meet attachment needs
- Child experienced parents as rejecting or dismissive of attachment needs
- Caregivers may have had rigid ideas about parenting, unseen, controlled, and rejected child's unique self
- Effects: dismisses own attachment needs, strong sense of self, independent, challenging personal relationships, deep sense of connection longing but rarely allowed to experience it due to shame or discomfort
- Goal: develop new, positive internal working model of relationships through imagining ideal parent figures who actively engage, accept, and encourage emotional needs.

### Psychoeducation About Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment

**Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment:**

- Result of unmet attachment needs in early childhood
- Parents may have been: inconsistently responsive, unresponsive, overly anxious, or distracted
- Led to internal working model (attachment map) of expecting to be overattuned to others and not attuned enough to oneself
- Resulted in outside-in orientation: focusing on others' states of mind at the expense of own
- Consequences include:
  - Difficulty managing emotions, leading to high anxiety or anger
  - Interference with self-development and exploration
  - Compulsive caretaking

**Causes:**

- Parental stresses, work responsibilities, or distractions
- Repeating of unmet attachment needs from parents' own experiences
- Overwhelm or inability to read child's signals
- Enlisting child to focus on parent's emotional needs instead of their own

**Effects:**

- Difficulty being attuned to one's own emotional experience
- Focusing too much on others' states of mind
- Overinvolvement in others' experiences and wants/needs
- Difficulty managing emotions, leading to high anxiety or anger
- Interference with self-development and exploration
- Compulsive caretaking

**Goal:**

- Develop a new, positive internal working model of relationships
- Inside-out orientation: awareness of one's own feelings and wants/needs
- Balanced and truly mutual relationships
- Strong, independent sense of self
- Encouragement of exploration and discovery

**Creating Ideal Parent Figures:**

- Deeply interested in individual
- Attuned to individual's needs
- Capable of providing right responsiveness in various situations
- Calm individuals when anxious
- Encourage curiosity and exploration while being supportive
- Help create new possibilities for self-expression and growth.

### Psychoeducation About Disorganized Attachment

**Disorganized Attachment:**

- Category identified in Adult Attachment Interview
- Result of unmet attachment needs in early childhood
- Causes:
  * Prolonged separations
  * Parents as frightening, confusing, or disconnected
  * Caregivers described as aggressive, disruptive, loud, or fearful
  * Parents felt overwhelmed with responsibilities and unable to respond consistently
  * Unresolved loss or trauma affecting parenting abilities

**Effects of Disorganized Attachment:**

- Both source of security and threat for the child
- Impossible dilemma: needing safety and comfort vs. fear of harm
- Fear and mistrust around people, increased fear arousal
- Unsuccessfully seeking safety in attachment relationships
- Inconsistent attachment behaviors: disconnecting or intensely clinging
- Interpersonally described as bossy, compulsively caretaking, or fearful
- Internal experience lacks coherence and may include dissociative experiences

**Dissociative Experiences:**

- Sense of being "out of it"
- Rapidly shifting between different aspects or parts of the self
- Shifting between different mood states (frightened, angry, helpless)
- Temporarily losing connection to where one is
- Periods of time that can't be remembered or accounted for

### Our overall goal is to help you to develop a new, different, positive internal working model of relationships so that you will no longer find yourself

**Text Summary:**

* The goal is to help individuals develop a new, positive internal working model of relationships by creating "ideal parent figures" (IPFs) through imagination.
* IPFs are safe, strong, predictable, and encouraging parents who provide security, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, and support for best self-development.
* Address treatment-frame problems with a mutual understanding of how infractions will be handled.
* Early in treatment, address noncollaborative nonverbal and verbal behavior to promote collaborative communication.
* Introduce IPF protocol:
  * Clarify difference between memory and imagination.
  * Use imagination to create ideal parents who provide basic felt attachment security.
  * Gradually introduce qualities consistent with the five primary conditions that promote secure attachment.
  * Gradually individualize IPF qualities based on patient's attachment prototype and experiences with early caregivers.

**Creating Ideal Parent Figures:**

* Develop new, positive internal working model of relationships.
* Use imagination to create safe, strong, predictable, and encouraging parents.
* IPFs provide security, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, and support for best self-development.

**Treatment Frame:**

* Address treatment-frame problems with a mutual understanding of how infractions will be handled.
* Use a written treatment-frame contract for clarity and to prevent misunderstandings.

**Nonverbal Communication:**

* Early in treatment, address noncollaborative nonverbal behavior.
* Foster metacognitive awareness of nonverbal types of noncollaborative behavior.
* Carefully match and change spontaneous nonverbal communication to promote greater collaboration.

**Verbal Communication:**

* Early in treatment, address noncollaborative verbal behavior.
* Encourage ongoing exploration and clarification of attachment themes for dismissive patients.
* Encourage staying on topic and making points succinctly for anxious-preoccupied patients.
* Frequently clarify communications for disorganized patients to promote metacognitive relating of variables.

**Introducing Ideal Parent Figures:**

* Clarify difference between memory and imagination.
* Use imagination to create ideal parents who are ideally suited to patient's nature and needs.
* Establish inner conditions for imagery, including calm and relaxed body focus and feeling like a very young child.
* Imagine different set of parents who provide basic felt attachment security.
* Address resistances and difficulties with the basic protocol.

**Subsequent Ideal Parent Figure Sessions:**

* Introduce qualities consistent with the five primary conditions that promote secure attachment.
* Emphasize particular conditions needed by the patient based on their attachment prototype.
* Gradually individualize IPF qualities based on experiences with early caregivers and etiological factors of insecure attachment type.

### Therefore, shape the IPF imagery to include calm, comforting, and predictable behavior; provision of a safe haven; being fully present and real; caref

**IPF Imagery and Interactions:**

* Shape IPF imagery to include calm, comforting, and predictable behavior
* Provide a safe haven and be fully present and real
* Carefully attune to patient's fear or mistrust of attachment
* Consistently soothe acute or chronic fear arousal
* Respond contingently
* Show fierce protectiveness from harm or abuse
* Set appropriate limits during aggressive arousal episodes
* Encourage both attachment and exploratory behavior (Chapters 8, 11, 12, and 13)

**Metacognitive Skills:**

* Support basic and intermediate skills for each attachment type:
  * Dismissing: Enhance identification of state of mind and contextual effects
  * Preoccupied: Foster mentalizing stance
  * Disorganized: Enhance mentalizing and reflective capacity (Chapters 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13)
* Gradually introduce later intermediate and advanced skills:
  * Dismissing: Awareness of contextual effects, wider perspective, interconnectedness
  * Preoccupied: Metacognitive awareness of state organization and metacognitive orientation
  * Disorganized: Metacognitive awareness of state organization and orientation, wider perspective (Chapters 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13)
* Toward later phases, introduce advanced skills: interconnectedness, central guiding purpose, sensitivity to knowledge acquisition (Chapters 7 and 9)

**Treatment Progress:**

* Notice, point out, and discuss signs of treatment progress and success with the patient (Chapter 15)

**Later Phases:**

* Toward later phases, promote self-development and secure intimacy to consolidate gains and encourage healthy exploratory behavior outside therapy (Appendices A and B)
* Developing a self-report measure of mentalizing, the "Reflective Function Questionnaire" (not available at time of book preparation)

### CHAPTER 15 Treatment Outcomes Indicators of Successful Treatment

**Chapter 15: Treatment Outcomes**

**Indicators of Successful Treatment**

1. **Achievement of earned secure attachment:**
   - Change from insecure (Ds1, Ds2, Ds3, E1, E2, E3, CC) to secure (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) attachment as measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).
2. **Formation of a new, positive stable internal working model for healthy adult attachment:**
   - Development of a new representation for healthy attachment through ideal parent figure imagery and secure therapeutic relationship.
   - Balance between attachment and exploratory behaviors in relationships with therapist and outside therapy.
3. **Capacity for adult secure intimacy:**
   - Development of an internal working model for what a secure intimate relationship would be.
   - Making partner choices and engaging in behaviors that match the new positive map of secure intimacy.
4. **Manifestation of metacognitive skills:**
   - Increase in general metacognitive capacity using Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S).
   - Assessment of specific metacognitive skills using Metacognitive Assessment Scale (MAS).
5. **Healthy collaborative behavior:**
   - Adherence to treatment-frame behaviors outlined in the treatment contract.
   - Increases in nonverbal and verbal collaborative behavior.
6. **Achievement of high coherence of transcript and coherence of mind on the AAI:**
   - Significant increase in coherence of transcript and coherence of mind based on AAI transcripts.
7. **Resolution of unresolved status (Ud) with respect to trauma and loss:**
   - Change from clinically significant Ud score above 5.5 to below the cutting score of 5.5 by the end of treatment.
8. **No longer meeting diagnostic criteria for personality disorder, dissociative disorder, or any trauma-related diagnosis in DSM-5 or ICD-10:**
   - Many patients with attachment disturbances no longer meet diagnostic criteria for these disorders by the end of Three Pillars attachment-based treatment.

### A Case Illustration of Successful Treatment and Its Measurement

**Case Illustration:** A 46-year-old woman with a history of severe childhood abuse sought consultation after nine years of psychodynamically based trauma treatment. She met SCID-D criteria for Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and had extremely low memory suggestibility.

**Background:** Five years into the treatment, she began reporting memories of physical and sexual abuse by her father, leading to a focus on trauma processing. Memories expanded to include siblings and adult friends, resulting in increased dissociation and alter personality states. Her previous therapist noted her inability to bond with her children and lack of mention of her mother for five years.

**Assessment:** Initial assessment using the Attachment Interview (AAI), SCID-D, and Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) revealed a CC/Ud classification with unresolved status for childhood physical and sexual abuse and loss of father as an adult. She met full DID criteria on the SCID-D. Her pre-treatment DIS-Q scores were in the range predictive of DDNOS but lower than expected for full DID. Her TSI profile showed a clear mixture of hyperarousal and dissociative trauma symptoms.

**Treatment:** Given her diagnosis, treatment focused on resolving disorganized attachment according to the Three Pillars model without trauma processing. After two and a half years, she was re-assessed and showed significant improvement:

* AAI: Overall coherence score increased from 1.0 to 7.0; able to give all five adjectives for early childhood relationship with mother and provide clear memories. Idealization of mother continued but not clinically significant.
* SCID-D: No evidence of alter personality states, loss of executive control, or current dissociative amnesia.
* TSI: All scores slightly above normal range but below clinically significant levels for all trauma symptoms.
* DIS-Q: Post-treatment scores showed a drop in all dissociative features.

**Conclusion:** Successful treatment of DID without trauma processing, as measured by various assessments. The patient's disorganized attachment was resolved using the Three Pillars model.

### FIGURE 15.1. Pre-and Post-treatment Response on the Dissociation Questionnaire With respect to trauma symptoms, the post-treatment TSI revealed that a

**Case Study:** A patient underwent attachment-based therapy without trauma processing or depression-focused interventions.

**Trauma Symptoms:**
- Pre-treatment Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI): All five clinical scales above cutting score, all validity scales within normal range.
- Post-treatment TSI: All clinical scales fell below cutting score.
- Figure 15.2 shows pre- and post-treatment TSI profiles.

**Depression:**
- Pre-treatment Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-1) score: Moderate-to-severe depression (21).
- Post-treatment BDI-1 score: Asymptomatic range (7).
- Figure 15.3 shows the drop in depression.

**Findings:**
- Significant reduction in dissociative, traumatic, and depressive symptoms and disorders.
- Attachment-based treatment increased organization of mind, leading to positive effects on trauma-related symptoms independently of trauma processing or depression focus.

**Implications:**
- Traditional phase-oriented trauma treatment may not be effective for patients with complex trauma and disorganized attachment due to potential interference with treatment progress and resolution.
- The Three Pillars attachment-based treatment can resolve disorganized attachment, dissociative symptoms, traumatic symptoms, and depressive symptoms without specific interventions.

### A Pilot Outcome Study

**Three Pillars Treatment: A Pilot Outcome Study**

* The study involved 12 patients treated by the book's authors, with pre- and post-treatment Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance Inventory (AAI) assessments.
* Interscorer agreement for AAIs was 100% between two scorers.
* Pre-treatment AAIs: 67.6% received "cannot classify" (CC), 33.3% received "preoccupied" (E) classification, and 50% had unresolved status with respect to trauma or loss.
* Average pre-treatment AAI coherence was very low at 2.21.
* All patients achieved earned secure status on the AAI after an average of 3.4 years of treatment.
* Coherence of transcript significantly increased from 2.21 to 7.91 (p < 0.001, d = 6.23).
* Reflective functioning scores also improved significantly from 1.68 to 4.36 (p < 0.001, d = 2.34).
* The Three Pillars treatment is effective in fostering metacognition and attachment repair.
* This pilot study suggests that the Three Pillars treatment is not a short-term intervention but can lead to significant improvements in attachment security over an extended period.
* The findings illustrate the efficacy of the approach, with detailed descriptions intended to stimulate larger-scale outcomes research.

**Three Pillars Treatment Model**

* Integration of best principles and practices for addressing attachment disturbances in adults.
* Respects the importance of the patient's relationship with the therapist as a secure base.
* Includes specific methods targeting deficiencies and problematic patterns in adult patients.
* Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) method:
  * Remaps new, positive attachment representations.
  * Patients create an "ideal" internal model of attachment that best fits their needs.
  * Therapist relies on the patient's inner knowing and imagination to shape the model.
* IPF method can be challenging for patients but leads to rich and deep experiences of ideal care.
* Therapist does not have to embody all that each patient needs; instead, they help shape the patient's imagination.

### The “real” aspects of the therapist are bound to contribute to periodic treatment ruptures. When understood and responded to according to the principl

**Three Pillars Model of Therapy**

- Periodic treatment ruptures are inevitable due to the therapist's "real" aspects but can be resolved using this model
- No focus on painful past experiences, except during initial evaluation
- Co-create an imagined childhood with positive experiences
- Work in present, focusing on metacognitive and collaborative experiences
- Address pain from past experiences within the context of one or more pillars
- Trauma history is addressed when sufficient structure for affect regulation is built
- Development of the Three Pillars model draws from essential components of maternal responsiveness

**Three Pillars**

1. **Metacognitive Pillar:**
   - Therapist's attuned presence and contingent responsiveness to patient's metacognitive functioning
   - Use of affective marking to help build recognition and identification of inner states
   - Fosters development of metacognitive capacity
2. **Collaborative, Cooperative Pillar:**
   - Therapist's careful, attuned presence and responsiveness to patient's nonverbal and verbal experience
   - Enhances collaborative, cooperative capacity
3. **Ideal Parent Figure:**
   - Consistently and accurately attuned to patient's behavior, internal state, and developmental level
   - Recognizes when soothing is needed and provides it effectively
   - Responds with expressed delight to patient's being and behaviors
   - Provides attuned and responsive support for exploration

**Effects of Three Pillars Model:**

- Rapid pace of change for patients
- Relief from pain, greater self-confidence and agency
- Better, more satisfying and fulfilling relational experiences
- Effectiveness proven through clinical experience and small pilot study
- Looking forward to future outcome studies and refinements

### Appendix A The Core Self, Proactive Self-Agency, Self-Esteem, and the “Best” Self Normal and Incomplete Self-Development

**Self-Development and the Psychological Sense of Self**

- The psychological sense of self develops gradually from infancy to adulthood.
  - **Neonates**: No predefined or developed sense of self.
  - **Infancy (6-18 months)**: Capacity for self-observation and representational thinking emerges, defining the initial structuralization of the self.
    * Early childhood: Concrete operational thinking leads to an internal sense of mind, rich emotional life, and peer involvement.
    * Adolescence: Formal operational thinking enables handling complex social relationships and infinite possibilities.
  - **Adulthood**: Self evolves as cognitive structures continue to develop.

**Experiential Consequences of a Psychological Sense of Self**

- Central organizing principle for daily life.
  * A clearly defined sense of self is necessary for everyday experiences to be organized around it.
  - Lack of a clear sense of self can lead to trying to define the self from the outside-in.
- Subjective sense of coherence of mind.
  * Provides a direct, immediate sense of internal organization of thoughts and emotions.
  * People with a strong sense of self experience their internal world as organized; those without it may feel disorganized.
- Sense of continuity across time, place, and state.
  * A person with a strong sense of self feels like the same person throughout developmental stages.
  * Lack of self-development can result in feelings of constant change and instability.

**Weak or Arrested Self-Development**

- Three forms: false self, fragile self, and incomplete self.

**False Self**

- Never develops a clear sense of the self and defines it from the outside-in.
- Presents the self accordingly to read others for cues about expectations.
- Example: Chauncey Gardiner (Being There).

**Fragile Self**

- Experiences some degree of personal self but keeps it deeply hidden due to fear of negative reactions from others.
- Fears destruction of the private self.

**Incomplete Self**

- Shows some degree of self-development but remains incomplete and fragile due to early learned chronic hypervigilance about others' states and needs.
- Attends to and responds to others at the expense of the self.
- Example: Leonard Zelig (Zelig).

**Implications for Psychotherapy**

- Therapy can help individuals develop a stronger sense of self by encouraging self-observation, reflection, and self-assertiveness.
- Understanding weak or arrested self-development can aid in tailoring therapeutic interventions to specific needs.

### The foundational task for self-development is the establishment of a core experiential sense of self. From this core emerges self-definition, or the p

**Self-Development and the Core Experiential Sense of Self**

- Establishing a core experiential sense of self is foundational for self-development.
- The core self is the foundation for self-definition, which are consistent and stable aspects of the self.
- Evoking the core self can be done at any time and is sometimes referred to as the "feeling of selfness."
- Object relations theory suggests this ability comes from evocative memory.
- Self-agency emerges from the core self, allowing individuals to feel effective and have impact on others and the world.
- Lack of self-agency results in difficulty being effective and little awareness of impact on others.
- Self-esteem is the linking of positive affect with the self-representation.
- Healthy self-esteem allows for a full sense of one's best self to develop.
- Therapeutic interpretation of deficits in self-development is not effective, instead focus on:
  - Systematic introduction and repetition of positive imagery
  - Cultivating each dimension of self: core self, self-definition, self-agency, self-esteem, best self.

**Dimensions of Self**

* **Core Self:** foundation for self-development, can be evoked at any time
* **Self-Definition:** consistent and stable aspects of the self
* **Self-Agency:** feeling effective and having impact on others and the world
* **Self-Esteem:** linking positive affect with the self-representation
* **Best Self:** full sense of one's best self develops once self-esteem is stable.

**Methods for Promoting Self-Development**

- Therapeutic interpretation of deficits in self-development is not effective.
- Focus on systematic introduction and repetition of positive imagery to enhance each dimension of self.

### Methods for Developing the Core Sense of Self When a patient does not have a core sense of self and lacks clarity about self-definition, self-developm

**Core Sense of Self Development Protocol**

* Step 1: Scene Generation for Core Self
  * Therapist introduces suggestions to help patient define qualities of positive core self through scene visualization
  * Instructions can be varied to prompt imagination and establish a sense of core self
* Step 2: Defining and Enumerating Unique Qualities
  * Patient reflects on scene to discover specific core self qualities
  * Therapist supports conditions for discovery and exploration, free from expectations
* Step 3: Amplification of Self-Qualities
  * Therapist mirrors, emphasizes, and amplifies reported qualities to strengthen patient's experience
* Step 4: Stabilization and Maintenance of Self-Qualities
  * Therapist helps patient recognize that core self-qualities are always present and stable
  * Uses time distortion techniques to enhance recognition and familiarity
* Step 5: Transferring Self-Definitions to Other Contexts
  * Patient imagines embodying named qualities in new scenes and situations
  * Therapist mirrors, amplifies, and supports patient's experience of self-qualities in various contexts

### COMMON PROBLEMS IN SELF-DEFINITION DEVELOPMENT IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE SELF-DEFICITS For patients with significant self-deficits, particular problems 

**Self-Definition Development in Patients with Severe Self-Deficits**

* Patients with significant self-deficits may encounter various problems during self-definition development:
  * Inability to attend and observe themselves
  * Poor self-observational ability
  * Difficulty recognizing core self during imagination task
  * Focus on others' expectations
  * False self-expression
  * Guarded private self
  * Negative self-talk

**Inattention and Poor Self-Observation**

* Patients with attention deficits require concentration training before self-definition exercises.
* Exercises to develop self-observation and metacognitive reflection: behavioral self-monitoring, journal writing.

**Difficulty Recognizing Core Self**

* Suggest patients become fully present with themselves and focus on immediate sensory experience.
* Encourage awareness of core self as a whole or specific qualities.

**Focus on Others' Expectations**

* Patients should find their deeper sense of self beyond others' expectations.
* They don't need to be concerned about what others want them to be like.

**False Self-Expression**

* Authentic self-expression is accompanied by congruent affect.
* Emphasize authenticity of self-qualities.

**Guarded Private Self**

* Suggest patients share qualities they never show to anyone else or things they value about themselves.

**Negative Self-Talk**

* Patients should not engage with negative thoughts but let them go immediately upon noticing them.
* Negative thoughts can be treated as an old acquaintance and ignored.
* The pattern of negative self-talk will eventually settle down when no longer engaged with.

### Methods for Developing Proactive Self-Agency The next task of self-development, beyond self-definition, is the development of self-agency. Self-agency

**Self-Agency Development**

* Internal representation of being an active, effective agent in the world
* Developed through mastery and self-efficacy experiences
* Emerges during "practicing" period of early childhood with motor development and language use
* Contributes to a sense of making the world happen rather than the world happening to us

**Characteristics of Healthy Self-Agency**

* Proactive: able to assess needs and organize behavior toward goals
* Good time organization
* Little internal contradiction between goal-states
* Strong sense of self-efficacy and mastery
* Active stance toward external events and internal state

**Characteristics of Lack of Self-Agency**

* Ineffective and helpless
* Passive-dependent: letting others define goals and means
* Impulsive: lack of internal action-planning
* Inability to predict causes and effects of behavior over time
* High internal conflict between goal-states
* World happens to them rather than contributing to making it happen

**Scene Generation for Proactive Self-Agency and Interpersonal Self-Agency**

* Therapist prompts for scenes focusing on self-agency and interpersonal self-agency
* Encourages description of what's happening and feelings during effective scenes
* Importance of cultivating strong interpersonal self-agency
* Application of amplification, stabilization, maintenance, and context-transferring principles to patient's responses.

### DEVELOPMENT OF GOAL-SETTING AND ACTION PLANS Another important component of working with patients with underdeveloped self-agency is fostering the dev

**Goal-Setting and Action Plans**

* Fostering development in patients with underdeveloped self-agency
* Process begins with goal identification
  * Patient identifies specific, realistic goal
  * Therapist helps patient connect to core sense of self if needed
* Development of action-planning process
  * Patient develops clear plan to achieve goal
  * Organizes sequence of steps in behavioral action plan
  * Rehearses action plan internally for mastery and effectiveness
  * Estimates realistic time frame for achieving goal
  * Daily evaluates progress toward goal
* Exploring causes and effects of behavior (for impulsive patients)
  * Reflects on past impulsive behaviors and their consequences
    * Short-term and long-term effects
    * Desired vs. undesired outcomes
  * Fosters metacognitive awareness for predicting consequences over time
    * Predicts possible outcomes of impulsive behavior
    * Rates likelihood of each outcome on a scale
    * Alters behavior to change outcome and increase desirability
  * Develops internal probabilistic representations of likely outcomes of specific behaviors, reducing impulsiveness.

### REDUCING CONTRADICTORY GOAL-STATES Emmons (1999) found that human goal-strivings are complex and that personal strivings typically entail a variety of

**Reducing Contradictory Goal-States**

* Emmons (1999): Human goal-strivings are complex, with personal strivings typically involving overlapping and contradictory goals.
* Healthiest individuals show least internal contradiction across goals and experience comfortable self-agency.
* Those with intense, competing contradictions become inhibited in areas of their lives due to uncomfortable affect associated with conflicting goal-states.
* Two ways to reduce contradiction and resulting conflicting goal-states in therapy:
  * Prioritize goals based on importance or significance to core self and develop action plans toward them.
    * Diminishing less important competing goals leads to less internal contradiction.
  * Articulate a clear, central guiding purpose or ultimate concern to subsume all goals and strivings.
    * Helping patients identify their ultimate concerns can point them in the direction of reducing conflicting goal-states over time.

**Being Proactive**

* Developing maturity in self-agency includes a proactive stance.
* Patients can anticipate outcomes and respond proactively to keep action plans on track.
* Foster a proactive stance by encouraging reflection on desired outcomes, predicting responses, and planning accordingly.

**Methods for Developing Healthy Self-Esteem**

* Sandler's definition: Self-esteem is the developmental linkage of positive emotional states to self-representation.
* Consistent expressed delight from attachment figures during childhood is crucial for healthy self-esteem development.
  * Parents openly expressing positive feelings toward their child.
  * Positive emotional expression pervades interactions and internalized by the child, leading to healthy self-esteem.
* Repeated experiences of mastery in childhood contribute to healthy self-esteem.
  * Mastery leads to greater self-esteem but can be used as an overcompensation for absent positive mirroring.
* Structure and consistent limit-setting are essential for older children's self-esteem development.
* Self-psychology approach to psychotherapy focuses on reducing negative interactions and vulnerability, but does not directly address the development of positive associations to the self-representation.
* Positive self-esteem protocol: Directly and systematically evoke positive feeling states in conjunction with the self-representation within and across sessions until patients can do so most of the time in everyday life.
  * Components include situation-based self-esteem enhancement, enhancement of self-esteem in relationships, skill development for quicker positive self-esteem evocation, stress challenge, and integrating self-esteem as a way of being.

### SITUATION-BASED SELF-ESTEEM ENHANCEMENT Even people with chronically impaired self-esteem are able to think of situations where they feel good about t

**Situation-Based Self-Esteem Enhancement**

* People with impaired self-esteem can think of situations where they feel good about themselves
* Positive self-esteem experiences linked to activity and mastery in certain situations
* Protocol begins with scene generation: therapist asks patient to imagine a situation where they're feeling especially good about themselves
* Focus on affect amplification to help patient intensify positive feelings
* Extend duration of positive self-feelings through direct suggestions or generating multiple scenes
* Patient practices imagining situations that evoke positive self-feelings and focusing on them as homework

**Enhancing Self-Esteem in the Context of Relationships**

* More difficult for patients to evoke positive self-feelings in relationships than activities
* Therapist asks patient to imagine a situation where they're feeling especially good about themselves in relation to others or being respected/appreciated by them
* Apply methods for affect amplification and extending duration of positive self-states as before

**Skill Development**

* Develop skill in generating positive self-feelings quickly and for longer durations, and generalizing learning across contexts
* Rapidly evoke positive self-states: therapist helps patient access positive feelings about themselves more quickly
* Extend duration of positive self-states: patient holds positive feelings for longer periods within and outside therapy sessions
* Generalize positive self-feelings to other situations: patient brings positive feeling into new situations not normally associated with it
* Use anchoring scale to promote metacognitive awareness and evaluate progress
* Patient's goal is to sustain positive self-feelings throughout most of the day, nearly every day. Eventually, patient takes on task of maintaining good feelings about themselves daily between sessions in all situations.

### STRESS CHALLENGE The next step is to maintain positive self-feelings in situations that the patient has associated with strong negative self-feelings.

**Stress Challenge:**

- Therapist helps patient maintain positive self-feelings in previously challenging situations.
- Patient imagines feeling good about themselves in difficult situations.
- Therapist uses techniques to amplify positive states and extend their duration.
- Patient is encouraged to test progress by putting themselves in challenging situations.

**Integrating Self-Esteem as a Way of Being:**

- Positive self-esteem becomes a way of being, not just an activity.
- Therapist encourages patient to imagine scenes of contentment and self-acceptance.
- Patient is encouraged to focus on being valued without needing to do anything.

**Developing the Best Self:**

- Therapist helps patient cultivate their best self, representing their strongest and most unique sense of self.
- Patient generates scenes of experiencing their best self and enhances awareness of its qualities.
- Patient transfers "best-self state of mind" to different situations for improved experiences.

**Best-Self Method:**

- Originally a hypnotic method developed by Erika Fromm.
- Used extensively in couples therapy and performance excellence training.
- Involves imagining a situation that evokes one's best self and transferring it to current situations for improved experiences.

**Fostering Uniqueness of Self and Vital Engagement:**

- Parents are encouraged to support their child's discovery and strengthening of uniqueness, free from expectations.
- Therapist suggests imagining scenes that foster vital engagement in life with enthusiasm and passion.

### Self-Development From an Attachment Perspective The self-development protocol described in this appendix emphasizes the developmental line of self as 

**Self-Development from an Attachment Perspective**

- Self-development protocol focuses on the development of core-self experience and definition, self-agency, and self-esteem independently of attachment relationships.
- Included as an appendix for clinicians to learn separately from attachment development.
- For patients with personality and dissociative disorders, focus on both self-development and positive attachment representations.
- Principles for self-development applied in the context of ideal parent figure (IPF) imagery:
  - **Patients with little or weak self-development:**
    - Encourage development of a strong, autonomous, and unique sense of self within secure-base experience of IPFs.
    - Reinforce contingency responsiveness, interpersonal self-agency, organized goal-directed behaviors, and metacognitive awareness.
  - **Patients with poorly developed self-agency:**
    - Shape IPFs to encourage response-eliciting behaviors and support development of goal-directed actions.
    - Collaboratively engage in metacognitive awareness of consequences.
  - **Patients with chronic low self-esteem:**
    - Emphasize repetition of scenes of parental delight and support for competence and mastery.
- Clinicians are encouraged to review Chapters 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 for further information on IPF imagery process.

### Appendix B Protocols for Developing Adult Secure Intimacy in Individuals and Caring Behaviors in Couples

**Secure Intimacy and Attachment**

- Secure attachment leads to healthy exploratory behavior in individuals (Bowlby)
- Adult romantic relationships can be attachment relationships if they manifest five conditions: safety/protection, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, and fostering self-development
- Secure attachment relationships promote secure intimacy, allowing exploration, growth, and discovery of unique selves

**Promoting Secure Intimacy in Psychotherapy**

- Once a patient achieves secure attachment status, therapy can focus on developing secure intimacy
- Patients create a vision for secure romantic attachment using five main conditions and individualized positive descriptors
- Hypnotherapy method of future-time orientation helps patients construct a vision of adult romantic secure intimacy
- Therapist mirrors, enhances, and encourages elaboration of elements described by the patient
- Patient holds awareness on total felt sense of secure intimacy vision and fixes it in mind as a guide for future relationships.

### ARTICULATING THE FIVE PRIMARY CONDITIONS THAT PROMOTE SECURE INTIMACY

**Secure Intimacy: Five Primary Conditions**

The therapist suggests focusing on five primary conditions that promote secure intimacy:

1. **Feeling Safe and Protected:**
   - Partner provides a sense of safety and protection in the relationship.
   - Patient describes specific ways partner achieves this.
   - Results in a positive state of mind.

2. **Careful Attunement:**
   - Partner is attentive to patient's needs, feelings, and internal state.
   - Patient describes scene and partner's actions.
   - Results in a secure feeling to discover and explore new ways.

3. **Comfort and Reassurance:**
   - Partner comforts and reassures the patient during emotional upsets.
   - Patient describes specific ways partner achieves this.
   - Results in a positive state of mind for both partners.

4. **Delight and Appreciation:**
   - Partner expresses delight and appreciation for the patient's being.
   - Patient describes specific ways partner shows this.
   - Results in a boosted self-esteem and positive relationship dynamics.

5. **Continuous Encouragement and Support:**
   - Partner encourages and supports the patient to bring out their best self.
   - Patient describes specific ways partner does this.
   - Results in personal growth and development within the relationship.

The patient is encouraged to visualize these scenes and describe the partner's actions, noticing the effects on their state of mind and the relationship.

### INDIVIDUALIZING THE SECURE INTIMACY PROTOCOL

**Individualizing the Secure Intimacy Protocol**

* Shape vision of secure intimacy for each patient based on early caregiver relationships
* Use information from Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and other available data
* Translate negative adjectives into positive opposites for developing secure attachment to ideal parent figures
* Use positive descriptors in development of adult secure intimacy imagery
* Individualize protocol based on patient's specific attachment needs:
  * Comfort with physical closeness: develop image of balanced relationship, ease with relying on partner, etc.
  * Difficulty relying on others or asking for help: ability to ask for advice/help, turn to partner in times of need, etc.
  * Mutuality: conviction that partner cares as much, comfort expressing emotions, etc.
  * Difficulty opening up emotionally: ease discussing problems with partner, comfortable expressing wide range of emotions, etc.
* For patients who experienced love and acceptance as conditional: imagine a relationship where you can be yourself and loved for who you are.

### Caring Behaviors in Couples

**Caring Behaviors in Couples:**

**Importance of Caring Behaviors in Romantic Relationships:**
- Patients in romantic relationships may feel confused by protocols suggesting future secure intimacy
- Current relationship and vision of secure intimacy may differ, which could undermine the relationship
- Restoration or development of healthy adult romantic secure intimacy is essential for optimal romance, caring, and relational satisfaction

**Background:**
- Couples therapists help couples with erosion of romance and caring behaviors
- Harville Hendrix developed Imago Relationship Therapy (IRT) to foster caring behaviors
- IRT based on attachment theory, object relations theory, developmental psychology, behavioral change techniques, and neuroscience

**IRT Process for Developing Caring Behaviors:**

**1. Current Caring Behaviors:**
- In a session with both partners, therapist asks each to list current caring behaviors of their partner using stem sentences
- Each person shares their list with the other while the other mirrors what was heard

**2. Early Relationship Caring Behaviors:**
- Each member of the couple visualizes and lists caring behaviors from early in the relationship
- They share their lists with each other and mirror what was shared

**3. Ideal Future Caring Behaviors:**
- Each partner imagines their ideal future caring behaviors and lists them using stem sentences
- They share their lists with each other and mirror what was shared

**Repeating the Exercise:**
- The three-part exercise can be repeated several times across sessions to foster restoration and development of caring behaviors and secure intimacy.
